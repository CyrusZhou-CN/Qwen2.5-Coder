## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of transaction costs across all insider trading transactions in the dataset. Use data from at least 10 different company files to ensure a comprehensive view. Set appropriate bin sizes to reveal the underlying distribution pattern, add a kernel density estimate overlay to smooth the distribution curve, and include summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) as text annotations on the plot. Color the histogram bars with a semi-transparent fill and ensure the plot has proper axis labels and a descriptive title.
