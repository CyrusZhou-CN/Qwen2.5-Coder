    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires substantial revisions to become effective. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Label Parsing (Critical Priority):**\n    *   For subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0), parse the file path strings used for y-axis labels and the legend. Extract the company ticker or name (e.g., 'PSA.csv' should become 'PSA' or 'Public Storage'). This is the single most important fix needed.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the vertical space between rows using a function like `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)` to prevent the title of subplot (1, 0) from overlapping with the x-axis of subplot (0, 0).\n    *   Increase the horizontal space between columns (`wspace=0.3`) to prevent the long (once fixed) y-axis labels from feeling cramped against the neighboring plot.\n\n3.  **Text and Title Improvements:**\n    *   In subplot (0, 0), add an x-axis label, e.g., 'Deviation from S&P 500 Average ($)'.\n    *   In subplot (0, 1), add an x-axis label, e.g., 'Average Transaction Value ($)'.\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), label the third axis, which should be 'Frequency Deviation' according to the prompt.\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), move the legend outside the plot area to prevent it from obscuring the radar chart, especially with 10 entries. For example: `ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.1, 1.05))`. \n\n4.  **Fulfill Task Requirements:**\n    *   **Sorting:** Re-plot the data in subplot (0, 0) so that the bars are sorted by the absolute magnitude of the deviation, from largest to smallest.\n    *   **Color:** The request to color by relationship type (CEO, Director) was missed. This would require restructuring the data. If that's not feasible, the current color scheme (positive/negative deviation) should be clearly explained in a legend or title.\n\n5.  **Visual Refinements:**\n    *   In subplot (1, 1), the y-axis tick labels are in scientific notation (e.g., '4e8'). Format them as currency or millions/billions for better readability (e.g., '$400M').\n    *   Ensure font sizes for subplot titles, axis labels, and tick labels are consistent across the entire dashboard for a more professional and cohesive appearance."
