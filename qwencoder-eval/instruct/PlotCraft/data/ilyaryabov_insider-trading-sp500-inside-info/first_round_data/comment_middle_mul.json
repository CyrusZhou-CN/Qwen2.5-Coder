    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, the following specific changes are recommended:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-left:** Add the required marginal histograms along the top and right axes of the scatter plot to show the distributions of 'Total Transaction Value' and 'Number of Unique Insiders', respectively.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-right:**\n    *   Implement the 'network-style connection plot' overlay on top of the heatmap to visualize relationships between variables, as specified in the prompt.\n    *   Adjust the plot margins or label positioning to ensure the y-axis tick labels ('Avg Transaction Value', 'Total Shares', etc.) are fully visible and not clipped.\n    *   Reduce the font size or use shorter abbreviations for the x-axis tick labels to prevent them from overlapping with the title of the subplot below.\n\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-left:**\n    *   Remove the single, unexplained trend line.\n    *   Add multiple, distinctively colored trend lines, one for each company sector as requested. \n    *   Include a legend that clearly maps each color to its corresponding sector.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-right:**\n    *   **Correct the Legend:** This is critical. Remove the current, incorrect legend. Create a new legend that only shows the seniority levels ('C-level', 'VP-level', 'Director', and the missing 'Other' category) and their corresponding colors.\n    *   **Add Missing Data:** Plot the data and a best-fit line for the 'Other' seniority category.\n    *   **Add Confidence Intervals:** Add shaded confidence interval bands around each of the best-fit lines to fulfill the prompt's requirement.\n\n5.  **Overall Formatting:**\n    *   **Title Hierarchy:** Reduce the font size of the main title ('Comprehensive Insider Trading...') significantly to be more proportional to the rest of the chart. Ensure the main title is bold to establish it at the top of the visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Consistency:** Standardize font sizes for axis labels and tick labels across all four subplots for a more cohesive and professional appearance."
