    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete re-implementation from scratch, as the current version is fundamentally broken. The primary issue is the failure to create a proper subplot grid, leading to all plots being drawn on top of each other.\n\n1.  **Layout Correction**: The most critical step is to correctly initialize a 3x2 subplot grid (e.g., using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(3, 2)`). Each of the six specified plots must be generated on its own dedicated axes object within this grid. No plot should ever be drawn on top of another.\n\n2.  **Subplot-Specific Implementation**:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Implement a proper joint plot or a scatter plot with manually created marginal histograms on the top and right edges of this specific subplot. Ensure the legend for transaction type is clear and visible.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1)**: Create a correlation heatmap (e.g., using `seaborn.heatmap`) for the specified variables. Annotate each cell with the correlation coefficient. The network graph is an advanced feature; prioritize a clear, well-labeled heatmap first.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Generate a true bubble plot where the `size` parameter is mapped to the total transaction value. Ensure the axes are correctly labeled as 'Average transaction cost' and 'Total number of transactions'. Provide a clear legend for the relationship types (CEO, Director, etc.).\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: Use a function like `seaborn.pairplot` to create the scatter plot matrix for the three specified variables. Use the `hue` parameter to color by the top 10 companies and ensure the legend is readable.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: In this single subplot, layer the visualizations correctly: place the violin plot in the background, overlay a semi-transparent box plot, and then plot the jitter points on top. This creates the requested composite view without clutter.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: The prompt's request for 'separate subplots' here conflicts with the 3x2 grid. A better approach is to create the 2D hexbin plot within this single subplot, showing the density for all data combined or for the most frequent insider relationship category. The title should clearly state what data is being shown.\n\n3.  **General Formatting and Clarity**:\n    *   After plotting, use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` to automatically adjust spacing and prevent titles and labels from overlapping between subplots.\n    *   Clean all legends to be descriptive and legible. Remove raw file paths and replace them with meaningful category names (e.g., company tickers).\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title 'Comprehensive Insider Trading Correlation Analysis Dashboard' should be the largest font, followed by subplot titles, then axis labels, and finally tick labels."
