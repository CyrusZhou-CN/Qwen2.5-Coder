    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the user's prompt. It cannot be improved with minor adjustments and must be completely recreated from scratch.\n\n1.  **Chart Type and Data Representation:**\n    *   Replace the current plots with a single histogram. The x-axis must represent 'Transaction Cost (USD)' and the y-axis must represent 'Frequency' (the count of transactions in each cost bin).\n\n2.  **Fulfill Core Requirements:**\n    *   Overlay a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve on the histogram to show a smoothed distribution.\n    *   Color the histogram bars with a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue) and set a semi-transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.6`) so the KDE line is visible through them.\n    *   Add a text box with the correct summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation). Ensure the labels are spelled correctly ('Mean', 'Median', 'Std Dev'). Place this box in a clear area, such as the top-right corner, ensuring it does not overlap with the data.\n\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Change the title to something descriptive and relevant, such as 'Distribution of Insider Trading Transaction Costs'.\n    *   Correct the axis labels to 'Transaction Cost (USD)' for the x-axis and 'Frequency' for the y-axis.\n\n4.  **Remove Extraneous Elements:**\n    *   Completely remove the pie chart.\n    *   Remove the nonsensical legend ('Glarbnok's Revenge'). If a legend is needed, it should clearly label the histogram bars and the KDE line.\n\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for a clean, professional look.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray and thin).\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy: make the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
