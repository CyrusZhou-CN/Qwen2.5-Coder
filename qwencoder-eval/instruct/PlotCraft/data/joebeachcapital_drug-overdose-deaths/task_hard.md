## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing drug overdose death trends across different dimensions. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Temporal Analysis
- Subplot 1: Monthly trend line chart with error bands showing confidence intervals for total overdose deaths, overlaid with a bar chart showing data completeness percentages
- Subplot 2: Seasonal decomposition plot combining line charts for trend, seasonal, and residual components of overdose deaths over time
- Subplot 3: Dual-axis plot with line chart showing predicted vs actual death counts over months, combined with a filled area chart showing the prediction uncertainty range

Row 2: Drug-Specific Patterns  
- Subplot 4: Stacked area chart showing the composition of deaths by different drug indicators over time, overlaid with individual line plots for each major drug category
- Subplot 5: Heatmap showing correlation between different drug types and time periods, combined with marginal histograms showing distribution of deaths by drug type
- Subplot 6: Radar chart comparing drug-specific death patterns across different time periods, overlaid with a polar bar chart showing relative magnitudes

Row 3: Data Quality and Uncertainty
- Subplot 7: Scatter plot with regression line showing relationship between data completeness and reported deaths, combined with a violin plot showing distribution of completeness scores
- Subplot 8: Box plots showing distribution of death counts by investigation status, overlaid with jittered strip plots showing individual data points
- Subplot 9: Time series plot with multiple confidence bands showing predicted values with different uncertainty levels, combined with bar chart showing footnote frequency over time
