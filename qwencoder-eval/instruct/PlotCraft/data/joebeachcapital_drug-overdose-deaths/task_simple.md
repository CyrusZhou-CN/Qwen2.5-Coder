## Instruction
Create a pie chart showing the composition of drug overdose deaths by different drug types (Indicator) for Alaska in 2015. Filter the data to include only records where 'Data Value' is not null and can be converted to numeric values. Use the 'Data Value' column to represent the size of each slice, and label each slice with both the drug type name and its corresponding value. Add a title "Drug Overdose Deaths by Drug Type - Alaska 2015" and ensure the chart is readable with appropriate colors and legend placement.
