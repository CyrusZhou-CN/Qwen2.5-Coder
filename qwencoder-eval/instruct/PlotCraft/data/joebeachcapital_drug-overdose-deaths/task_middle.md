# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of drug overdose deaths by different drug types in Alaska for 2015. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left subplot displays a horizontal bar chart showing the count of deaths for each drug indicator (use only rows where 'Data Value' is not null and can be converted to numeric), and the right subplot shows a pie chart of the same data to illustrate the proportional breakdown. Both charts should have the same drug categories, with consistent color coding between them. Include proper titles, labels, and a legend for the pie chart.
