    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the severe label clutter and overlap. To improve it: (1) Fulfill the prompt's requirement by replacing the direct labels with a legend. A legend placed to the right of the chart would cleanly list each drug type and its corresponding color. (2) If direct labeling is preferred over a legend, use leader lines (callouts) to connect labels to their respective slices, and manually arrange the labels around the chart to ensure there is no overlap. (3) For the very small, crowded slices, consider grouping them into a single 'Other' category to declutter the visualization. (4) The text 'Total Drug Overdose Deaths: 2151' is poorly placed; it should be a subtitle below the main title or an annotation in a clear area, not overlapping with chart elements. (5) The label for the largest slice ('Number of Drug Overdose Deaths') is confusing and should be clarified or renamed to reflect the actual data category it represents."
