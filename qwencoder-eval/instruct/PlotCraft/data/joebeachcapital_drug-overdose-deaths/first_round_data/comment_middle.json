    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revision to become effective. \n1. **Layout and Spacing:** The overall figure layout needs to be fundamentally changed. Increase the figure's width to give both subplots adequate space. Re-balance the subplot proportions; for instance, allocate more horizontal space to the bar chart in subplot (0, 0) so the bars are not so compressed. The pie chart in subplot (0, 1) should be made larger relative to its legend.\n2. **Pie Chart Labeling:** Remove the text labels from the pie wedges entirely, as they are the primary source of the overlap issue. The legend is sufficient for identifying the slices. If proportions are needed on the chart, use `autopct` to display percentages inside the wedges, ensuring the font size is small enough to fit.\n3. **Bar Chart Y-Axis Labels:** The y-axis labels in subplot (0, 0) are very long. To improve readability and layout, wrap the text of these labels onto multiple lines. This will prevent them from taking up excessive horizontal space.\n4. **Legend Optimization:** The legend for the pie chart is cluttered because it includes the raw death counts, which are already clearly shown in the bar chart. For a cleaner design, remove the numeric counts from the legend entries and only display the drug type categories.\n5. **Title Refinement:** The main title and the pie chart title are awkwardly split into multiple lines. Consolidate them into single, more concise lines. For example, the main title could be 'Drug Overdose Deaths by Type: Alaska, 2015'. The pie chart title could be simplified to 'Proportional Breakdown'."
