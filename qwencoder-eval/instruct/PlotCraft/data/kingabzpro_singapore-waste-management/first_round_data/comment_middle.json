    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the user's prompt. A complete recreation is necessary.\n\n1.  **Layout and Chart Type:**\n    *   Change the layout to the required 2x1 format (two rows, one column).\n    *   In the top subplot (0, 0), replace the pie chart with a stacked area chart to show 'Total Waste Generated' and 'Total Waste Recycled' over time.\n    *   In the bottom subplot (1, 0), replace the bar chart with a line chart to show the 'Recycling Rate' trend. Implement shaded error bands instead of error bars.\n\n2.  **Data and Content:**\n    *   Use the correct data for Singapore's waste management from 2003 to 2020.\n    *   Update all titles to be descriptive and relevant, e.g., 'Singapore Waste Generation and Recycling (2003-2020)' for the top plot and 'Recycling Rate Trend' for the bottom plot.\n    *   Correct all axis labels. Both plots should have 'Year' on the x-axis. The top plot's y-axis should be 'Waste (tonnes)', and the bottom plot's y-axis should be 'Recycling Rate (%)'.\n\n3.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   Switch to a professional, publication-ready style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   Establish a clear typographic hierarchy by making titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels.\n    *   Add a vertical dashed line across both subplots between 2017 and 2018 to mark the transition point as requested. Remove the nonsensical 'Zorgon Split' label.\n\n4.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   Replace the current color palettes entirely. Use a professional and harmonious color scheme. For the stacked area chart, consider using two shades of the same color (e.g., light blue and dark blue) or complementary colors (e.g., blue and gray). For the line chart, use a single, distinct color (e.g., dark green) for the line and a lighter, semi-transparent shade of the same color for the error band."
