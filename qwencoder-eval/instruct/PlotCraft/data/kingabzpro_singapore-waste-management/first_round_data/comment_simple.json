    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards.\n1.  **Layout Refinement:** Change the layout from the current 3x1 to a single 1x1 plot. Remove the two redundant subplots at (1, 0) and (2, 0).\n2.  **Text Content Correction:**\n    -   **Title:** Change the title from 'Banana Output Over Centuries' to a relevant title, such as 'Total Waste Recycled for Top 5 Waste Types (2003-2020)'.\n    -   **Axis Labels:** Swap and correct the axis labels. The x-axis label should be 'Year', and the y-axis label should be 'Total Waste Recycled (tonnes)'.\n    -   **Legend:** Replace the generic legend labels ('Glarbnok 0', 'Glarbnok 1', etc.) with the actual names of the top 5 waste types.\n3.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    -   **Background and Grid:** Change the plot background from black to white. Make the gridlines a light gray color and slightly thinner to be less obtrusive.\n    -   **Line and Marker Styling:** Significantly reduce the `linewidth` of the lines and the `markersize` of the data points to reduce clutter and improve readability, especially where lines intersect.\n4.  **Color Scheme Enhancement:** Replace the harsh neon color palette with a professional, colorblind-friendly palette. Consider using a standard palette like 'Tableau10' or a sequential palette if appropriate.\n5.  **Legend Placement:** Ensure the legend is clearly visible and does not obstruct the data lines. Placing it in the 'upper right' or 'best' location within the single plot would be appropriate."
