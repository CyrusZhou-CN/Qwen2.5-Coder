    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Critical Fix for Subplot (2, 1):** The current line chart must be replaced with a proper waterfall chart to show year-over-year increases and decreases in recycling. The cumulative line can then be overlaid as requested. The title and y-axis label must be updated to accurately reflect 'Year-over-Year Change'.\n2. **Layout Spacing:** Increase the vertical spacing (`hspace`) between the rows of subplots significantly to prevent titles from overlapping with the plots above them. A value of `hspace=0.8` or higher might be necessary.\n3. **Legend Management for Subplot (0, 0):** The legend is unusable. The best solution is to remove it entirely. To convey the information, either (a) group the many small categories into a single 'Other' category to simplify the chart and legend, or (b) annotate the largest areas directly on the plot. Also, the underlying data needs cleaning to merge duplicate categories like 'Ash & Sludge' and 'Ash and sludge'.\n4. **Legend Positioning for Subplot (1, 0):** The legend for the scatter plot is currently floating over subplot (0, 0). It should be moved inside its own axes, for example, to the 'upper left' corner, to contain it within its own plot.\n5. **Text Readability:** For subplots (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 0), the rotated x-axis labels are cramped. Consider reducing the font size or using abbreviations for the 'Waste Type' labels to allow for horizontal alignment, which is easier to read.\n6. **Dual-Axis Clarity in Subplot (0, 2):** The legend is redundant because the y-axis labels are color-coded to match the plots (blue for the line, orange for the bars). Remove the legend and rely on the colored axis labels for clarity."
