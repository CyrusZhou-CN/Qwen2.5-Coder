## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing Singapore's waste management evolution and energy savings potential from 2003-2020. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: (1) Top-left: Stacked area chart showing total waste generation trends over time with line overlay of overall recycling rates; (2) Top-center: Bar chart of recycling rates by waste type for 2020 with error bars showing variance across 2018-2020; (3) Top-right: Dual-axis plot combining line chart of total recycled tonnage over time with bar chart of energy savings potential.

Row 2: (4) Middle-left: Scatter plot of waste generation vs recycling rate by waste type with bubble sizes representing energy savings potential, overlaid with trend lines; (5) Middle-center: Stacked bar chart showing composition of recycled materials by year with line plot overlay of total energy saved; (6) Middle-right: Box plot distribution of recycling rates across years with violin plot overlay showing density.

Row 3: (7) Bottom-left: Heatmap of recycling performance by waste type and year with contour lines indicating energy efficiency zones; (8) Bottom-center: Waterfall chart showing year-over-year changes in total recycling with cumulative line overlay; (9) Bottom-right: Radar chart comparing 2020 performance across waste types with historical average overlay as filled area.

Calculate energy savings using the conversion factors from waste_energy_stat.csv and ensure all temporal trends span the complete 2003-2020 period by combining both datasets appropriately.
