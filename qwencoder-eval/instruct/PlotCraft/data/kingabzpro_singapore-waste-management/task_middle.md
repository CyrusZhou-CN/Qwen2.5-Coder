## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis showing Singapore's waste management evolution from 2003 to 2020. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays the total waste generated and total waste recycled as stacked area charts over time, and the bottom plot shows the recycling rate trend as a line chart with error bands representing the variation across different waste types for each year. Combine data from both time periods and highlight the transition point between 2017 and 2018 with a vertical line annotation.
