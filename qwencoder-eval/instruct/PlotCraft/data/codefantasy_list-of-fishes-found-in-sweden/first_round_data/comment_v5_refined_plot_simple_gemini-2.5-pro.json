    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data and Text Correction:** First, resolve the data inconsistencies. Combine the two 'Not evaluated' categories into a single, correct entry. Ensure all percentages shown on the chart match the legend exactly. Verify the total species count and make sure it matches the sum of the individual categories.\n2. **Layout and Sizing:** Dramatically increase the size of the pie chart to make it the central element of the visualization. Center the chart and its title on the canvas. Move the legend closer to the right of the chart to create a more cohesive unit. Relocate the 'Total Species: 252' text to serve as a subtitle directly below the main title for better context.\n3. **Color Scheme:** Replace the ineffective grayscale palette with a distinct and visually appealing color for each category. A qualitative color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer) would be ideal for ensuring clear differentiation between slices.\n4. **Labeling and Legend:** To fix the overlap, remove the percentage labels from within the smaller pie slices. Rely on the legend for these values, or use callout lines (leader lines) to place the labels in the white space outside the pie. For the 'Other' category, move the detailed list of sub-categories from the legend entry to a footnote below the chart to improve the legend's readability.\n5. **Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure the main title is the most prominent text element. The legend text and any annotations should be clear but smaller than the title. A larger, more colorful, and better-organized chart will naturally create a stronger visual hierarchy and a more professional appearance."
