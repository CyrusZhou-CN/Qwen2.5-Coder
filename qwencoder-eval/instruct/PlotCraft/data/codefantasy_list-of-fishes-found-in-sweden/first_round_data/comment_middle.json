    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart, several improvements are needed:\n1.  **Fix Pie Chart Labels (Subplot (0, 1)):** The overlapping labels are the most critical issue. Replace the direct labels for the smallest slices with a legend. Alternatively, group slices smaller than 2% into a single 'Other' category to declutter the chart.\n2.  **Improve Overall Layout:** Reduce the excessive horizontal space between the two subplots to create a more integrated visualization. Use a layout manager (like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`) to ensure better spacing and alignment. The tops of the two subplot titles should be vertically aligned.\n3.  **Enhance Bar Chart Readability (Subplot (0, 0)):** The x-axis labels are long and rotated. To improve readability, consider using a horizontal bar chart, which provides more space for long category labels. Alternatively, abbreviate the labels (e.g., 'Least Concern (LC), locally Endangered (EN)' could be shortened).\n4.  **Refine Color Palette (Subplot (0, 0)):** The legend for the stacked bar chart has 12 categories, and some colors are too similar. Use a color palette specifically designed for a high number of distinct categories (e.g., `matplotlib`'s 'tab20' or a ColorBrewer qualitative palette) to ensure each habitat type is easily distinguishable.\n5.  **Add a Suptitle:** To fulfill the prompt's goal of telling a 'cohesive story', add a main title (suptitle) for the entire figure, such as 'Fish Species Composition in Swedish Waters', to unify the two subplots."
