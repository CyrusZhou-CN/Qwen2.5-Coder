Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of fish species in Sweden by their conservation status and habitat preferences. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a stacked bar chart showing the count of fish species across different Red List Status categories, with each bar segment colored by habitat type. The right plot should show a pie chart breaking down the proportion of fish species by their occurrence patterns (Sporadic, Introduced, etc.). Add appropriate titles, legends, and ensure both plots complement each other to tell a cohesive story about fish biodiversity and conservation in Swedish waters.
