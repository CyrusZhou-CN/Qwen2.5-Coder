## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing how US traffic congestion patterns evolved from 2016 to 2022. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot combines a line chart showing monthly congestion event counts over time with a bar chart overlay displaying seasonal patterns (quarterly averages). The bottom plot should show a stacked area chart depicting the relative contribution of different severity levels or congestion types over time, revealing how the composition of traffic incidents changed throughout the years. Include trend lines and highlight any significant changes that might correlate with major events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic impact in 2020-2021).
