    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, focus on both task compliance and visual quality. \n\n**Task Compliance Corrections:**\n1.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the current plot with a proper time series decomposition plot, showing separate panels for trend, seasonal, and residual components. \n2.  **Subplot (1, 2):** Re-implement as a true slope chart. Use a diverging color palette (e.g., blue for decreasing severity, red for increasing) to color the lines connecting the years, as specified in the prompt.\n3.  **Subplot (2, 0):** The filled area should represent the range between the minimum and maximum state values at each year, not a solid block behind all lines. Use a semi-transparent fill to ensure the individual state lines remain visible.\n4.  **Subplot (2, 1):** Replace the scatter plot with a calendar heatmap. The trend lines for weekdays vs. weekends should be overlaid on this heatmap.\n5.  **Subplot (2, 2):** This subplot must contain two plots side-by-side: the existing Autocorrelation (ACF) plot and the missing Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plot.\n\n**Visual Quality Enhancements:**\n1.  **Global Layout:** Add the required main title, 'Comprehensive Analysis: US Traffic Congestion Temporal Evolution (2016-2022)', centered above the entire grid. Increase the `hspace` and `wspace` between subplots to improve separation and readability.\n2.  **Text and Axis Correction:** This is critical. Correct the x-axis tick labels on subplots (1, 0) and (2, 1) to show the correct 2016-2022 date range. \n3.  **Clutter Reduction:** In subplot (0, 2), remove the overlapping numerical labels from the contour lines. The color map and the lines themselves are sufficient to indicate intensity zones.\n4.  **Legend Correction:** In subplot (1, 2), ensure the legend accurately reflects the colors used for each season in the plot.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:** Lighten the weight of the black chart borders (spines) on all subplots for a cleaner, more modern aesthetic. Ensure font sizes for titles, labels, and ticks are consistent and legible across the entire figure."
