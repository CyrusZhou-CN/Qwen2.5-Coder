# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of US traffic congestion patterns from 2016-2022. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Annual trends analysis - (1,1) Line chart with confidence bands showing yearly congestion event counts overlaid with a bar chart of average severity by year; (1,2) Stacked area chart showing monthly distribution patterns across all years with a line overlay indicating peak congestion months; (1,3) Heatmap of congestion frequency by hour-of-day vs day-of-week with contour lines marking intensity zones.

Row 2: Seasonal decomposition - (2,1) Time series decomposition plot combining trend, seasonal, and residual components with error bands; (2,2) Violin plots showing congestion duration distributions by season overlaid with box plots and mean markers; (2,3) Slope chart connecting seasonal averages across years with diverging color coding for increasing/decreasing trends.

Row 3: Geographic-temporal patterns - (3,1) Multi-line time series showing top 10 states' congestion trends with filled areas between min/max values; (3,2) Calendar heatmap of daily congestion counts with overlaid trend lines for weekdays vs weekends; (3,3) Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots side-by-side showing temporal dependencies in congestion patterns.

Use the sample dataset for computational efficiency while ensuring each composite subplot reveals distinct temporal insights about traffic congestion evolution.
