## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing hypertension risk patterns across different patient groups. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Scatter plot with marginal histograms showing Age vs BMI, colored by hypertension status; (2) Top-center: Violin plot overlaid with box plot comparing stress scores across exercise levels, split by hypertension status; (3) Top-right: Stacked bar chart with error bars showing hypertension prevalence by BP history categories, with smoking status breakdown; (4) Middle-left: Radar chart comparing mean values of numerical features (Age, Salt_Intake, Stress_Score, Sleep_Duration, BMI) between hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups; (5) Middle-center: Heatmap with hierarchical clustering showing correlation matrix of numerical variables, annotated with correlation coefficients; (6) Middle-right: Grouped bar chart with line overlay showing medication usage patterns across different family history groups, with hypertension rates as the line; (7) Bottom-left: Parallel coordinates plot showing patient profiles colored by hypertension status, including normalized numerical features; (8) Bottom-center: Treemap showing the hierarchical composition of patients by Exercise_Level → Smoking_Status → Has_Hypertension; (9) Bottom-right: Network-style cluster plot using PCA to reduce dimensionality of numerical features, with nodes colored by hypertension status and sized by stress score.
