## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left, display a correlation heatmap showing relationships between all numerical variables (Age, Salt_Intake, Stress_Score, Sleep_Duration, BMI). In the top-right, create a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) for these same numerical variables, colored by hypertension status. In the bottom-left, show a scatter plot of BMI vs Salt_Intake with points colored by hypertension status and sized by stress score. In the bottom-right, create a box plot comparing the distribution of stress scores across different BP_History categories, with separate boxes for patients with and without hypertension.
