    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is task non-compliance. To fix this:\n1.  **Replace Subplot (0, 1):** The current scatter plot in the top-right position (0, 1) must be replaced entirely with a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) showing the relationships between all specified numerical variables (Age, Salt_Intake, Stress_Score, Sleep_Duration, BMI). The points within this pair plot should be colored by hypertension status as requested.\n2.  **Correct Axis Label:** The incorrect y-axis label 'Correlation Coefficient' on the current subplot (0, 1) is a major error and must be corrected to 'BMI' to accurately reflect the data being plotted, even before the plot is replaced.\n3.  **Restructure Box Plot (1, 1):** To improve clarity and better match the prompt, the box plot should be restructured. The x-axis should represent the 'BP_History' categories. Within each category, use hue to display two separate, side-by-side boxes for patients with and without hypertension. This would make the direct comparison more intuitive.\n4.  **Standardize Legends:** The legend labels in the box plot (1, 1) ('No Hypertension', 'Has Hypertension') are slightly inconsistent with the other plots ('Hypertension: No', 'Hypertension: Yes'). Standardize the legend text across all subplots for better consistency.\n5.  **Add a Main Title:** Consider adding a main figure title (suptitle) such as 'Comprehensive Analysis of Hypertension Factors' above all subplots to provide overall context for the 2x2 grid."
