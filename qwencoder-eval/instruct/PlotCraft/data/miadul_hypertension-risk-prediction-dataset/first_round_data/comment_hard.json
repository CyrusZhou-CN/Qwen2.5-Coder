    "improvement_suggestions": "<The primary issue is the failure to comply with the task instructions. The following changes are required to meet the prompt's requirements:\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Add marginal histograms to the top (for 'Age') and right (for 'BMI') of the scatter plot.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the current box plot with a violin plot to show the distribution shape, and then overlay the box plot on top of the violin plot.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 2):** Recreate this as a stacked bar chart where the bars are 'BP History' categories, and the stacks within each bar represent 'Smoking_Status'. Add error bars to indicate variability.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1):** Add dendrograms to the rows and columns of the heatmap to visualize the hierarchical clustering.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 2):** This plot is incorrect. It should be a grouped bar chart showing 'Medication Usage' patterns across 'Family History' groups, with an overlaid line plot representing 'Hypertension Rates' for each group.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 1):** This plot is incorrect. It should be a treemap illustrating the hierarchical composition of patients, structured as Exercise_Level → Smoking_Status → Has_Hypertension.\n7.  **Subplot (2, 2):** This plot is incorrect. It should be a network-style cluster plot based on the PCA results, where nodes are sized according to the 'Stress_Score' variable.\n\n**General Quality Improvements:**\n*   **Color Consistency:** Change the colors in the current subplot (1, 2) from green/orange to the blue/red palette used elsewhere to maintain a consistent visual language for hypertension status.\n*   **Labeling:** In subplot (0, 1), improve the x-axis labels for clarity, perhaps by using a multi-level axis to separate 'Exercise Level' and 'Hypertension'. Remove redundant axis labels in plots like (1, 2) and (2, 1) where the information is already present in the title.\n*   **Titles:** Make titles more descriptive and less redundant. For example, change 'Correlation Matrix' to 'Correlation Matrix of Key Health Metrics'."
