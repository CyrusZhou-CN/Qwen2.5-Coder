    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Layout Refinement:** Remove the empty top subplot (0, 0) entirely and generate a single 1x1 chart. This will fix the layout imbalance and remove the wasted space.\n2. **Data and Content Correction:** The chart must be regenerated using the correct data (BMI from the hypertension dataset). The number of bins in the histogram should be explicitly set to 15 as requested in the prompt.\n3. **Text Correction:** All text elements must be corrected. The title should be 'Distribution of BMI'. The x-axis label should be 'BMI', and the y-axis label should be 'Frequency' or 'Number of Patients'. The label for the vertical line should be 'Mean BMI'.\n4. **Color Scheme Enhancement:** Replace the current color palette. Use a single, more professional color for the histogram bars, such as a medium blue or steel gray. For the vertical mean line, use a distinct but not clashing color like dark red or orange.\n5. **Professional Formatting:** Switch to a white background and use subtle, light gray gridlines to improve readability and give the chart a publication-ready appearance. Make the chart title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n6. **Element Cleanup:** Remove the unexplained red exclamation marks near the mean line. Position the legend for the mean line (e.g., 'Mean BMI') outside the plot area or use a clear text annotation to avoid overlap with the data."
