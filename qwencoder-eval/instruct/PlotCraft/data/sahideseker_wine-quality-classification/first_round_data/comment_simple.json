    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Change Chart Representation**: The stacked histogram is ineffective. Replace it with one of the following to show the distributions clearly:\n   - **Overlaid Histograms**: Plot the three histograms on the same axes but use transparency (a low `alpha` value, e.g., 0.5) so that all distributions are visible through each other. This is the best way to compare shapes directly.\n   - **Faceted Histograms**: Create a 3x1 layout with three separate subplots, one for each quality category ('low', 'medium', 'high'). This provides the clearest, uncluttered view of each individual distribution.\n2. **Refine Binning**: The current binning (3 wide bins) is too coarse and hides all detail. Increase the number of bins significantly (e.g., `bins=20` or `bins=30`) or set a smaller bin width to reveal the actual shape and peaks of the distributions.\n3. **Improve Professional Formatting**:\n   - Set the chart background to white (`facecolor='white'`).\n   - Change the gridlines to be subtle, light gray lines (`color='lightgray'`, `linestyle='--'`).\n   - Enhance the visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n4. **Optimize Legend**: Move the legend to the 'upper right' or outside the plot area to prevent any overlap with the data bars.\n5. **Enhance Color Palette**: Consider using a more vibrant and harmonious color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer or viridis) to improve visual appeal and maintain clear distinction between categories."
