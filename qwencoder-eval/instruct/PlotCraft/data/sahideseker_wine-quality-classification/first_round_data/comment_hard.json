    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the complete failure to adhere to the task prompt. The model must generate the requested 3x3 grid with all nine specified chart types. \n\nFor the generated chart specifically, the following improvements are needed:\n1.  **Layout and Overlap:** The color bar in subplot (0, 2) must be moved outside the plot area to eliminate the severe overlap. A single, shared color bar for all three plots, placed to the right of the entire figure, would be a much better and more professional solution. This would also ensure all three heatmaps are the same size, creating a balanced layout.\n2.  **Color Consistency:** Use a single, appropriate diverging color map (e.g., 'RdBu_r') for all three heatmaps to represent positive and negative correlations consistently. The color scale limits should be standardized across all plots (e.g., vmin=-1, vmax=1) to allow for accurate visual comparison between the quality groups.\n3.  **Text and Labels:** Adjust the figure's left margin to prevent the y-axis labels in subplot (0, 0) from being cut off. The color bar label ('Correlation Coefficient') should be positioned horizontally above the bar or cleanly next to it, not overlapping the tick labels.\n4.  **Professional Formatting:** Remove the heavy black borders (spines) around each subplot for a cleaner, more modern aesthetic. Ensure font sizes for titles, labels, and annotations are consistent and create a clear visual hierarchy."
