    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the prompt in any way; it cannot be improved and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Start Over:** Discard the current visualization entirely.\n2.  **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid as specified in the prompt.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:** Generate a scatter plot matrix for the variables `fixed_acidity`, `residual_sugar`, `alcohol`, and `density`. Use color to distinguish the `quality_label` categories. Add a clear title like 'Pairwise Feature Correlations by Quality'.\n4.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** Generate a correlation heatmap for the same numerical variables. Annotate the cells with correlation coefficients and use a suitable diverging color map. Add the title 'Correlation Heatmap of Chemical Properties'.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:** Create a scatter plot of `alcohol` vs. `density`. Map point color to `quality_label` and point size to `fixed_acidity`. Include legends for both color and size. Add the title 'Alcohol vs. Density'.\n6.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** Create a bubble plot of `residual_sugar` vs. `fixed_acidity`. Map bubble size to `alcohol` content and bubble color to `quality_label`. Include legends. Add the title 'Sugar vs. Acidity'.\n7.  **Professional Formatting:** Use a clean, professional theme with a white background and subtle gridlines. Ensure all text (titles, axis labels) is legible, correctly spelled, and accurately describes the data. Use a harmonious, colorblind-friendly palette. Adjust subplot spacing to eliminate any overlap."
