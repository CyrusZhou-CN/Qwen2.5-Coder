# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationships between wine chemical properties and quality. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A scatter plot matrix showing pairwise correlations between all numerical features (fixed_acidity, residual_sugar, alcohol, density) with different colors for each quality_label category, (2) Top-right: A correlation heatmap displaying the correlation coefficients between all numerical variables, (3) Bottom-left: A scatter plot of alcohol vs density with points colored by quality_label and sized by fixed_acidity levels, and (4) Bottom-right: A bubble plot showing residual_sugar vs fixed_acidity where bubble size represents alcohol content and colors represent quality categories. Include appropriate legends, titles, and ensure the visualization reveals how chemical properties correlate with each other and influence wine quality classification.
