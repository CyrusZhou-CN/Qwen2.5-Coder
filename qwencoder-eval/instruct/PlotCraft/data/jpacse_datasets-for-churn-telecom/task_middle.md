# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization using a 2x1 subplot layout. In the top subplot, generate a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between key numerical variables: MonthlyRevenue, MonthlyMinutes, DroppedCalls, UnansweredCalls, CustomerCareCalls, and MonthsInService. In the bottom subplot, create a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) focusing on the three most correlated variables identified from the heatmap, with points colored by churn status to reveal how customer behavior patterns differ between churners and non-churners.
