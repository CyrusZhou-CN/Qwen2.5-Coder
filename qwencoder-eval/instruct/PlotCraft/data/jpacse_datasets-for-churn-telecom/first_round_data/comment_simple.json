    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and unrelated to the task. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single (1x1) plot. Use a histogram to show the distribution of 'MonthlyRevenue'. Overlay two density curves (Kernel Density Estimates) on this histogram, one for churned customers and one for non-churned customers.\n2. **Data and Labels:** The x-axis must represent 'Monthly Revenue'. The y-axis should be labeled 'Density'. The chart title should be descriptive, such as 'Distribution of Monthly Revenue by Churn Status'.\n3. **Legend:** Add a clear legend to distinguish the density curves for 'Churned' and 'Not Churned' customers.\n4. **Color and Formatting:** Adopt a professional aesthetic. Use a white background. Make the gridlines subtle and light gray. Use a neutral color for the histogram bars (e.g., light gray with transparency) and two distinct, professional colors for the density curves (e.g., a muted blue and orange).\n5. **Text Formatting:** Ensure the title is bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy."
