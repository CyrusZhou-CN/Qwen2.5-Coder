    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete regeneration from scratch due to fundamental layout and chart type errors.\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Implement a proper 2x1 subplot grid using a function like `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 1)`. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust `hspace` to ensure there is sufficient vertical space between the top and bottom subplots to prevent any overlap.\n2.  **Top Subplot (0, 0) - Heatmap:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the current pair plot with a standard correlation heatmap (e.g., `seaborn.heatmap`). This plot should be a single grid where each cell shows the correlation coefficient between two variables.\n    *   **Title:** Assign a clear and concise title, such as 'Correlation Heatmap of Service Variables', directly to this subplot.\n3.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0) - Pair Plot:**\n    *   **Placement:** Generate the scatter plot matrix (pair plot) within the bottom subplot axes object.\n    *   **Title:** Place the title 'Scatter Plot Matrix of Top 3 Correlated Variables' correctly above this subplot, not in the middle of the figure.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Ensure the axis labels for the variables in the pair plot are legible and do not overlap. If necessary, reduce the font size or rotate the labels slightly for clarity.\n4.  **Overall Figure Title:** Add a main, overarching title to the entire figure (e.g., 'Comprehensive Correlation Analysis for Customer Churn') to provide context for both subplots. This title should have a larger font size than the subplot titles to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
