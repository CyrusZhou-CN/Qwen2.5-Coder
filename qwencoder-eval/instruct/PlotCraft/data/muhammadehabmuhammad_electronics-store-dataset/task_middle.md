# Visualization Task - Middle

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive monthly sales analysis visualization using a 2x1 subplot layout. The top subplot should display a line chart showing total monthly revenue trends throughout 2019, with each month's revenue calculated as the sum of (Quantity Ordered × Price Each) for all orders. The bottom subplot should create a stacked area chart showing the monthly composition of sales by product category, where you group similar products into categories (e.g., "Mobile Devices" for iPhone/Google Phone, "Audio" for headphones/airpods, "Computing" for laptops/monitors, "Accessories" for cables/batteries, "Appliances" for washing machine/TV). Both charts should clearly show how sales patterns and product mix evolved over the 12-month period, with proper titles, axis labels, and legends.
