## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of electronics store sales throughout 2019. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots):
1. Monthly Revenue Trends: Combine a line chart showing total monthly revenue with bar charts overlaying monthly order counts, including error bars showing revenue variance
2. Product Category Performance Over Time: Create a stacked area chart showing revenue contribution by product category (phones, laptops, accessories, etc.) with a secondary line plot showing the diversity index (number of unique products sold each month)
3. Seasonal Sales Patterns: Display a polar/radar chart showing average daily sales by month with overlaid scatter points representing peak sales days, plus a secondary line showing temperature correlation if geographic data suggests seasonal patterns

Bottom row (2 subplots):
4. Geographic Sales Evolution: Combine a time series line chart showing sales trends for top 5 cities with a heatmap overlay showing monthly sales intensity by city, including trend arrows indicating growth/decline direction
5. Price Point Analysis Over Time: Create a composite chart with violin plots showing monthly price distribution of sold items, overlaid with box plots for quartile information, and a trend line showing average transaction value evolution

Each subplot must include proper legends, annotations for significant events (like holiday seasons), and use consistent color schemes. The visualization should reveal insights about seasonal patterns, geographic preferences, product lifecycle trends, and pricing strategies throughout the year.
