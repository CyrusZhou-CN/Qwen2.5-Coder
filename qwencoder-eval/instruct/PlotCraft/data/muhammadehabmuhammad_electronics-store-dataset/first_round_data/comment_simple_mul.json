    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the complete absence of data. The monthly sales revenue must be calculated and plotted as a line chart with markers. The x-axis is incorrectly formatted; the numerical float tick labels (-0.04, -0.02, etc.) must be replaced with labels representing the 12 months of 2019 (e.g., 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar' or 1, 2, 3). The y-axis range and tick labels are also incorrect; they should be adjusted to reflect the actual revenue data, ensuring the currency formatting is applied to meaningful values. Once the data is plotted, ensure the line and markers are visually distinct and use a color that provides good contrast against the white background."
