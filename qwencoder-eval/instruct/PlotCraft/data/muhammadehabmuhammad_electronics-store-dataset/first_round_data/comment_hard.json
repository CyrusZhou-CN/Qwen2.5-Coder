    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, several major adjustments are needed:\n\n1.  **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the overall figure size and use a function like `tight_layout()` with padding or `subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6, wspace=0.4)` to create significant vertical and horizontal space between all subplots. Raise the main title using `fig.suptitle('...', y=1.0)` to prevent it from overlapping with the subplot titles.\n\n2.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,2):** Change the orange line overlay to a bar chart overlay as specified in the prompt.\n    *   **Subplot (1,1):** Replace the current plot entirely. Use `violinplot` for the monthly price distribution and overlay `boxplot`s to show median trends, not a line plot.\n    *   **Subplot (1,3):** Add the 'residual' component to the seasonal decomposition plot.\n    *   **Subplot (2,3):** Debug the data calculation to produce a valid correlation matrix without 'nan' values. The green 'trend arrows' are meaningless on the diagonal and should be removed.\n\n3.  **Text and Labeling:**\n    *   **Subplot (1,1):** Correct the left y-axis label to 'Price ($)'.\n    *   **Titles:** Add descriptive titles to all subplots that are missing them, such as for subplots (1,0) and (1,1).\n    *   **Tick Labels:** For all subplots, ensure x-axis tick labels ('Jan', 'Feb', etc.) are fully legible and do not overlap. This can be achieved through better spacing and potentially a slightly smaller font size.\n\n4.  **Visual Element Refinements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** The current bar chart for 'New Products' vs 'Returning Products' is confusing. Change this to a grouped bar chart to allow for clear side-by-side comparison each month.\n    *   **Color Scheme:** Implement a single, consistent color palette across the entire figure to create visual coherence as requested. For example, use the same sequential palette (e.g., 'viridis') for all plots showing monthly progression and a consistent set of distinct colors for different categories or overlays (e.g., always use red for trend lines).\n\n5.  **Annotations:** Add the required statistical annotations (means, trends, etc.) to other relevant subplots beyond just subplot (2,0) to fulfill the prompt's requirements."
