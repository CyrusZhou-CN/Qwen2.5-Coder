    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete restructuring and several corrections to meet the task requirements and professional standards.\n\n1.  **Layout Restructuring:** Re-organize the entire figure into the specified 3x2 grid. The prompt describes 5 plots, so one subplot (e.g., at position (1, 2)) should be left empty to maintain the grid structure.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Monthly Revenue Trends:**\n    *   **Correct Data Mapping:** Swap the data mappings. The line chart should represent 'Total Monthly Revenue' and use the left y-axis. The bar chart should represent 'Monthly Order Counts' and use the right y-axis.\n    *   **Add Missing Elements:** Implement the required error bars on the revenue plot (which should now be the line chart, or on the bars if revenue is kept as bars) to show variance.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 2) - Seasonal Sales Patterns:**\n    *   **Add Scatter Points:** Overlay distinct scatter points on the polar chart to represent 'peak sales days', as requested. These should be separate from the line markers.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Geographic Sales Evolution:**\n    *   **Combine Charts:** This is the most critical change. Rework this to be a *single* composite chart. Combine the 'Geographic Sales Evolution' line chart and the 'Monthly Sales Intensity Heatmap' into one subplot. For example, the heatmap could serve as the background for the line chart.\n    *   **Add Trend Arrows:** Add the requested trend arrows to the ends of the lines on the line chart to indicate the growth or decline direction in the final months.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Price Point Analysis:** This plot is well-executed. Place it in this position within the new 3x2 grid.\n\n6.  **Titles and Text:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Reformat the main title to be on a single line or have a more logical two-line break with consistent formatting.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Ensure all axis labels are correct, descriptive, and consistently styled across all subplots."
