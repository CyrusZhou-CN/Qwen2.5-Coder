    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's requirements. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout and Theme:** Change the layout to the specified 2x2 grid. Adopt a professional, publication-ready theme with a white background, black text, and subtle gray gridlines.\n2.  **Main Title:** Set a relevant main title like 'Comprehensive Monthly Sales Trend Analysis' and make it bold and larger than the subplot titles for a clear visual hierarchy.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:** Create a combined chart. Plot 'Total Monthly Revenue' as a line chart on the primary y-axis. Use `twinx()` to add a secondary y-axis and plot 'Total Units Sold' as a bar chart. Ensure both axes are clearly labeled.\n4.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** Generate a stacked area chart showing the revenue contribution of the top 5 products over the 12 months. Use a clear, qualitative color palette and include a legend to identify each product.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:** Plot the 'Average Order Value' as a line chart. Use `fill_between()` to add shaded error bands representing the confidence intervals.\n6.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** Create a dual-axis plot. Plot 'Unique Orders Count' as a line chart on the primary y-axis. Use `twinx()` to add a secondary y-axis and plot 'Number of Unique Products Sold' as a bar chart. Label both axes appropriately.\n7.  **Annotations and Labels:** Ensure all subplot titles, x-axis labels (e.g., 'Month'), and y-axis labels are accurate and descriptive. Add annotations to highlight the peak and low performance months on the relevant charts as requested in the prompt."
