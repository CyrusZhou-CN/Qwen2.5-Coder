## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x4 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of electronics store sales throughout 2019. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 (Monthly Sales Performance): 
- Subplot 1: Monthly total revenue with overlaid line chart showing average order value trends
- Subplot 2: Monthly product quantity sold with overlaid line chart showing number of unique orders
- Subplot 3: Monthly product diversity (number of unique products sold) with overlaid bar chart showing top-selling product category percentage
- Subplot 4: Monthly geographic distribution heatmap with overlaid line chart showing city concentration index

Row 2 (Product Category Evolution):
- Subplot 5: Stacked area chart showing monthly revenue composition by product categories with overlaid line chart showing category diversity index
- Subplot 6: Monthly price distribution violin plots with overlaid box plots showing median price trends
- Subplot 7: Product lifecycle analysis showing new vs returning products per month with overlaid line chart showing product turnover rate
- Subplot 8: Monthly seasonal decomposition showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of total sales

Row 3 (Customer Behavior Patterns):
- Subplot 9: Monthly order frequency distribution histogram with overlaid KDE curve and mean/median lines
- Subplot 10: Geographic sales concentration by month using bubble plots with city size representing sales volume, overlaid with trend lines
- Subplot 11: Monthly purchase timing analysis showing hourly distribution heatmap with overlaid line chart showing peak hour trends
- Subplot 12: Correlation matrix heatmap showing relationships between monthly metrics (revenue, quantity, diversity, geographic spread) with overlaid trend arrows

Each composite chart should include proper legends, color coding for temporal progression, and statistical annotations (means, trends, significant changes). Use a consistent color palette across all subplots to maintain visual coherence while highlighting temporal patterns and business insights.
