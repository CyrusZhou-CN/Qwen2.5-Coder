## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing equestrian competition patterns across Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Olympic vs Paralympic comparison):
- Subplot 1: Create a grouped bar chart showing horse age distribution (binned into 5-year groups) overlaid with violin plots showing the density distribution for both Olympic and Paralympic horses across both years
- Subplot 2: Design a bubble chart where bubble size represents the number of horses per country, x-axis shows the percentage of male horses, y-axis shows the percentage of female horses, with different colors for Olympic vs Paralympic, and add marginal histograms

Middle row (Temporal analysis):
- Subplot 3: Construct a slope chart connecting Tokyo 2020 to Paris 2024 participation rates by country (top 15 countries by total horses), overlaid with error bars showing the variance in horse ages per country
- Subplot 4: Build a stacked area chart showing the evolution of horse sex distribution from 2020 to 2024, combined with line plots tracking the average age of horses by sex over time

Bottom row (Breeding and ownership patterns):
- Subplot 5: Generate a network-style scatter plot where each point represents a country of birth, positioned by the number of horses bred there (x-axis) vs. the number of different competing countries using those horses (y-axis), with connecting lines showing major breeding relationships, overlaid with a correlation heatmap in the background
- Subplot 6: Create a hierarchical treemap showing horse ownership patterns by country and discipline, combined with a parallel coordinates plot connecting Country → Country of Birth → Horse Sex → Discipline to reveal breeding and competition pathways
