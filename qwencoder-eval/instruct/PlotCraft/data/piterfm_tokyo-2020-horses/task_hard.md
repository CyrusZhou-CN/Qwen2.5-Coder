## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Olympic and Paralympic equestrian competitions from Tokyo 2020 to Paris 2024. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 - Horse Demographics Evolution:
- Subplot 1: Combine stacked bar chart showing horse age distribution by year/competition type with overlaid line plot showing mean age trends
- Subplot 2: Combine grouped bar chart of horse sex distribution with pie chart overlay showing gender proportion changes
- Subplot 3: Combine horizontal bar chart of top 10 horse birth countries with scatter plot overlay showing country diversity index over time

Row 2 - Competition Structure Analysis:
- Subplot 4: Combine stacked area chart showing event participation over time with line plot overlay tracking total athlete count
- Subplot 5: Combine violin plot of horse age distributions by discipline with box plot overlay for each competition year
- Subplot 6: Combine heatmap of country participation by event type with bar chart overlay showing medal potential countries

Row 3 - Breeding and Ownership Patterns:
- Subplot 7: Combine network-style scatter plot of sire lineage connections with histogram overlay of breeding frequency
- Subplot 8: Combine treemap of horse ownership patterns with line chart overlay showing ownership concentration trends
- Subplot 9: Combine correlation heatmap of horse characteristics (age, birth country, color) with marginal distribution plots showing how these relationships evolved between competitions

Each subplot must include proper legends, color coding for different years/competition types, and statistical annotations where relevant.
