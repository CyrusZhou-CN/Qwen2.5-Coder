Create a comprehensive temporal analysis comparing the evolution of equestrian participation between Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left shows a combined line and bar chart displaying the number of participating countries over time for both Olympic and Paralympic events, with bars showing total countries and overlaid lines showing the trend; (2) Top-right presents a stacked area chart showing the composition of horse ages (grouped into age ranges: young 6-10 years, mature 11-15 years, senior 16+ years) across the four competitions; (3) Bottom-left displays a slope chart connecting the top 10 most represented countries between 2020 and 2024, showing how their horse participation numbers changed; (4) Bottom-right shows a dual-axis chart with bars representing the total number of horses per competition and a line showing the average horse age trend across the timeline.
