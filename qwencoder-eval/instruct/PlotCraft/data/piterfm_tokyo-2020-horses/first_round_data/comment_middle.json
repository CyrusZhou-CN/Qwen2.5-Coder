    "improvement_suggestions": "1.  **Chart Type Correction**: The most critical change is to replace the grouped bar chart in subplot (1, 0) with the requested **slope chart**. This would involve plotting points for 2020 and 2024 for each gender category ('Gelding', 'Mare', 'Stallion') on parallel vertical axes and connecting the corresponding points with lines to visually emphasize the change.\n2.  **Professional Formatting**: To elevate the chart to a publication-ready standard, apply a professional style. This includes setting the background of the figure and all subplots to white, making the gridlines a light gray and less prominent (e.g., `linestyle='--'`, `alpha=0.6`), and removing unnecessary top and right spines on each subplot.\n3.  **Typographic Hierarchy**: Improve the visual hierarchy by making the title of each subplot bold and slightly larger than the axis labels. This helps guide the reader's eye and establishes a clear structure.\n4.  **Data Clarity in Subplot (1, 1)**: Address the inconsistency in subplot (1, 1). Either change the title to '2024 Equestrian Participation and Percentage Change from 2020' to match the data, or, preferably, modify the chart to include bars for both 2020 and 2024 participation counts as grouped bars, which would better fulfill the comparative nature of the prompt.\n5.  **Layout Refinement**: Adjust the positioning of the y-axis labels in all four subplots to bring them closer to the axes. This will create a more cohesive and professional-looking layout by reducing the awkward gap.\n6.  **Axis Label Rotation**: While the rotated x-axis labels in subplots (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 1) prevent overlap, consider a smaller rotation angle (e.g., 30-45 degrees) with right-alignment (`ha='right'`) for better readability if space permits."
