    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout:** Create a proper 2x2 subplot grid. Ensure sufficient padding between subplots to prevent titles and labels from overlapping.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the pie chart with a combined bar and line chart. The x-axis should represent the four competitions (Tokyo/Paris Olympics/Paralympics). The y-axis should show the count of countries. Use bars for the total count and an overlaid line for the trend. The title should be relevant, e.g., 'Participating Countries Over Time'.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the stacked bar chart with a stacked area chart. The x-axis should represent the four competitions. The y-axis should show the number of horses, with stacked areas representing the required age groups ('Young 6-10 years', 'Mature 11-15 years', 'Senior 16+ years'). Add a clear legend and a title like 'Horse Age Composition'.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the scatter plot with a proper slope chart. It should have two vertical axes for '2020' and '2024'. Use points and connecting lines to show the change in horse participation for the top 10 countries. Label the lines with country codes. The title should be 'Change in Participation for Top 10 Countries'.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the single-axis chart with a dual-axis chart. The primary y-axis should display the total number of horses using bars. The secondary y-axis should display the average horse age using a line plot. The x-axis should show the four competitions. The title should be 'Total Horses and Average Age Trend'.\n6.  **Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   Use a white background for the entire figure.\n    *   Adopt a professional and harmonious color palette (e.g., using blues, grays, and oranges) instead of the current neon colors.\n    *   Establish a clear typographic hierarchy: make the main figure title the largest, subplot titles smaller and bold, and axis labels/tick labels the smallest.\n    *   Ensure all text (titles, labels, legends) is accurate, correctly spelled, and directly related to the equestrian data as specified in the prompt."
