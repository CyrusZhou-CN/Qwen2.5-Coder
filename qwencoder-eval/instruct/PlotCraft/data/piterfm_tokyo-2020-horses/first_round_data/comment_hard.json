    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the complete failure to adhere to the specified composite chart types; the chart should be regenerated to meet the task requirements. For the existing visual, the following improvements are needed:\n\n1.  **Layout and Spacing:** The most critical issue is the title overlap. The main figure title must be moved upwards to provide clear separation from the first row of subplots. Use a layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)`) to ensure proper spacing and prevent any element collisions. Standardize the vertical and horizontal spacing between all subplots for a balanced grid.\n\n2.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Axis Ticks:** In subplots (1,0) and (2,2), change the x-axis ticks from floating-point numbers to integers (e.g., 2020, 2024) for clarity.\n    *   **Label Consistency:** In subplot (0,2), standardize the country labels to use either full names or 3-letter codes consistently, not a mix.\n    *   **Label Orientation:** In subplots (0,1) and (1,1), adjust the figure size or label formatting to prevent the x-axis labels from needing rotation, which hinders readability.\n\n3.  **Visual Consistency:**\n    *   **Color Palette:** Implement a unified color palette across the entire figure. For instance, consistently use one specific color for 'Olympic' data and another for 'Paralympic' data in every subplot where this distinction is made (e.g., subplots (0,0), (1,0), (2,2)).\n    *   **Font Styling:** Ensure consistent font sizes and weights for all subplot titles, axis labels, and tick labels throughout the 3x3 grid.\n\n4.  **Element Refinement:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** The red line representing the mean is overly thick and visually dominant. Reduce its line width and consider a dashed style to make it less distracting from the primary box plot data.\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** Add a small amount of padding between the heatmap and its color bar to improve visual separation."
