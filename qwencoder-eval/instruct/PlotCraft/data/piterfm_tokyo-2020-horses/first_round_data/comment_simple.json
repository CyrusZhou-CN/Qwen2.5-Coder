Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality chart:\n1.  **Start Over:** The current chart is irrelevant. A new visualization must be created.\n2.  **Correct Chart Type and Layout:** Use a single histogram in a 1x1 layout to show the distribution, as requested.\n3.  **Use Correct Data:** Load the four specified horse datasets and create a combined series of the 'Year of Birth' data for the histogram.\n4.  **Implement Correct Text and Labels:**\n    -   **Main Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Horse Birth Years at the 2020 and 2024 Olympic & Paralympic Games'.\n    -   **X-Axis Label:** Label the x-axis 'Year of Birth'.\n    -   **Y-Axis Label:** Label the y-axis 'Number of Horses' or 'Frequency'.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    -   **Background:** Use a white background for a professional, publication-ready appearance.\n    -   **Color:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., steelblue or darkgray) for the histogram bars.\n    -   **Gridlines:** Add subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines to aid in reading the frequency values.\n    -   **Typography:** Make the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    -   **Binning:** Select an appropriate number of bins (e.g., bins representing 2-year intervals) to clearly reveal the shape of the distribution without being too noisy or too coarse."
