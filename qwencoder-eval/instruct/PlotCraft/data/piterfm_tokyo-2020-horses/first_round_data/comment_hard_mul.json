    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary need is to fulfill the complex requirements of the prompt. Each subplot must be rebuilt as a composite visualization.\n\n1.  **General Formatting:** Change the chart's theme to have a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines to meet professional standards.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Horse Age Distribution:** Overlay semi-transparent violin plots on top of the existing grouped bars to show the density distribution of ages for Olympic and Paralympic horses.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Gender Distribution:** Add marginal histograms to the top and right of the plot area to display the distributions of 'Percentage of Male Horses' and 'Percentage of Female Horses' respectively.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Country Participation:** Add error bars to the data points for each country to visualize the specified variance in horse ages.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Sex Distribution Evolution:** Correct the x-axis to show discrete years (2020, 2024). Overlay line plots on the stacked area chart to track the average age of Stallions, Geldings, and Mares over the two Olympic years.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 0) - Breeding Network:** Add lines connecting the scatter plot points to illustrate the major breeding relationships. Implement a subtle correlation heatmap in the plot's background. Use a text repulsion algorithm to prevent country labels from overlapping and remove redundant abbreviations (e.g., keep 'Germany', remove 'GER').\n7.  **Subplot (2, 1) - Ownership Patterns:** This subplot must be completely replaced. Generate the two specified charts: a hierarchical treemap showing ownership by country and discipline, and a parallel coordinates plot to visualize the pathways from Country -> Country of Birth -> Horse Sex -> Discipline."
