    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Resolve Text Inconsistency**: The most critical issue is the conflict between the title and the x-axis. Either change the title to 'Distribution of Horse Ages in 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Competitions' to match the x-axis, or re-plot the data to show 'Birth Year' on the x-axis as requested in the prompt.\n2. **Improve Distribution Comparison**: The overlapping histograms are difficult to interpret accurately. A better approach would be to use a step-style histogram (`histtype='step'`) which plots only the outlines of the bins. This allows for a clear comparison of the distribution shapes without any occlusion.\n3. **Enhance Visual Hierarchy**: Make the chart title bold to distinguish it more clearly from the axis labels and establish a stronger visual hierarchy.\n4. **Refine Axis Ticks**: The x-axis ticks are at intervals of 2.5, which is slightly unnatural for age. Consider setting the ticks to more intuitive integer intervals, such as every 2 or 5 years, to improve readability.\n5. **Add Subtle Gridlines**: To make it easier to read the values on the y-axis, consider adding light gray, dashed horizontal gridlines. This can guide the eye without cluttering the visualization."
