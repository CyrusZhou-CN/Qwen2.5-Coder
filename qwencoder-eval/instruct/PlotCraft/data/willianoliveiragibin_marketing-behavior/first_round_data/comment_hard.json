    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt in any capacity. It cannot be improved and must be discarded. A new chart should be generated from scratch with the following directives:\n1.  **Adhere Strictly to the Prompt:** The entire chart must be regenerated to follow the user's instructions precisely.\n2.  **Correct Layout:** Create a 3x3 subplot grid as specified.\n3.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** For each of the nine subplot positions, generate the exact chart type with the specified data and overlays as requested in the prompt. For example:\n    *   Subplot (0, 0): Must be a scatter plot of 'Likes' vs 'Purchase_Likelihood' with a regression line and confidence intervals.\n    *   Subplot (1, 2): Must be a correlation heatmap of the specified metrics.\n    *   Subplot (2, 2): Must be a combined violin and strip plot.\n4.  **Use Relevant Data and Text:** All titles, axis labels, and annotations must be directly related to the topic of 'marketing engagement metrics and purchase behavior'. All nonsensical text must be removed.\n5.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a standard white background.\n    *   Choose a clean, professional, and harmonious color palette.\n    *   Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. All text must be legible and correctly positioned.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy with a main figure title and descriptive titles for each of the nine subplots."
