    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete deviation from the prompt and cannot be salvaged. It must be recreated from scratch. Follow these steps to meet the original request:\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x1 subplot grid, with one chart on top of the other.\n2.  **Top Subplot (0, 0) - Scatter Plot:**\n    *   Change the chart type to a scatter plot.\n    *   Set the x-axis to 'Time_Spent_on_Platform' and the y-axis to 'Engagement_with_Ads'.\n    *   Color the scatter points based on the 'Purchase_Likelihood' variable and include a color bar legend.\n    *   Size the scatter points based on the 'Likes' variable and include a size legend.\n    *   Provide a descriptive title, such as 'Correlation between Time Spent and Ad Engagement'.\n3.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0) - Correlation Heatmap:**\n    *   Replace the pie chart with a correlation heatmap.\n    *   Calculate and display the correlation matrix for the specified variables: 'Likes', 'Shares', 'Comments', 'Clicks', 'Engagement_with_Ads', 'Time_Spent_on_Platform', 'Purchase_History', and 'Purchase_Likelihood'.\n    *   Use a diverging color palette (e.g., blue-white-red) to clearly distinguish between positive, neutral, and negative correlations.\n    *   Add a descriptive title, such as 'Correlation Matrix of Engagement and Purchase Metrics'.\n4.  **General Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for a professional, publication-ready appearance.\n    *   Replace the current garish color scheme with a more professional and harmonious palette.\n    *   Ensure all titles and labels are accurate, descriptive, and correctly spelled as per the prompt.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than axis labels.\n    *   Adjust spacing between the two subplots to ensure no elements overlap."
