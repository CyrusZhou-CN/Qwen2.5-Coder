    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to meet the user's request and should be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type and Data:** Replace the pie chart and scatter plot with a single histogram. The x-axis of the histogram should represent the 'Purchase_History' values, and the y-axis should represent the frequency (count).\n2. **Layout and Composition:** Use a standard 1x1 layout for the single histogram. Ensure there is balanced white space around the chart.\n3. **Color Scheme:** Switch to a professional color palette. Use a white background. For the histogram bars, use a single, muted color like a medium blue or gray. Avoid the current black background and neon colors.\n4. **Text Content:** \n   - Change the main title to something clear and relevant, such as 'Distribution of Purchase History'.\n   - Label the x-axis 'Purchase History' and the y-axis 'Frequency'.\n   - Remove the irrelevant secondary title ('Glarbnok Revenue Patterns') and the distracting yellow annotation ('MAXIMUM DATA INSIGHT').\n5. **Formatting:** \n   - Remove the heavy white gridlines. If gridlines are necessary, they should be subtle, light gray, and horizontal only.\n   - Establish a clear text hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
