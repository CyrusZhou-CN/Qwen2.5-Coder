# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between user engagement metrics and purchase behavior. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot is a scatter plot showing the correlation between Time_Spent_on_Platform (x-axis) and Engagement_with_Ads (y-axis), with points colored by Purchase_Likelihood and sized by the number of Likes. The bottom plot should be a correlation heatmap displaying the correlation coefficients between all numerical engagement metrics (Likes, Shares, Comments, Clicks, Engagement_with_Ads, Time_Spent_on_Platform) and the target variables (Purchase_History, Purchase_Likelihood). Include appropriate titles, labels, and legends for both subplots.
