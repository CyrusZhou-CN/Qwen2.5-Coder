Here is a step-by-step guide to create the correct visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout:** Start by creating a 2x1 subplot figure (two rows, one column).\n2.  **Top Subplot (0, 0) - Stacked Bar Chart:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Implement a stacked bar chart.\n    *   **Axes:** Set the x-axis to represent 'Animal Species' and the y-axis to represent 'Symptom Frequency'.\n    *   **Data:** For each animal species (each bar), the segments of the bar should represent the counts of the top 10 most common symptoms. Each colored segment corresponds to one symptom.\n    *   **Legend:** Create a legend that clearly maps each color to its corresponding symptom name.\n    *   **Title:** Set a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Frequency of Top 10 Symptoms by Animal Species'.\n3.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0) - Pie Chart:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Implement a pie chart.\n    *   **Data:** The pie chart should represent the overall proportion of each animal species in the dataset. Each slice's size should be proportional to the species' count.\n    *   **Labels:** Label each slice with the species name and its percentage contribution to the total.\n    *   **Title:** Set an appropriate title, such as 'Overall Proportion of Animal Species'.\n4.  **General Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Background & Colors:** Use a standard white background. Select a clear, professional, and preferably color-blind friendly palette for the symptoms in the bar chart and the species in the pie chart.\n    *   **Text:** Ensure all text (titles, axis labels, tick labels, legends) is legible, correctly spelled, and appropriately sized. Avoid any text overlap.\n    *   **Spacing:** Use `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust subplot parameters to ensure there is adequate spacing between the two plots and all their elements for a clean, professional appearance."
