    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to address the user's prompt and needs a complete overhaul. \n1. **Adhere to the Prompt:** The entire visualization must be replaced. Discard the bar chart and scatter plot and create a single pie chart as requested.\n2. **Correct Data Representation:** The pie chart should visualize the distribution of animal types. Each slice must represent a specific animal, with its size proportional to its percentage in the dataset.\n3. **Implement Required Text Elements:** Add a relevant title, such as 'Distribution of Animal Types in the Study'. Label each pie slice clearly with the animal's name and its percentage value (e.g., 'Lions: 25%').\n4. **Improve Color Scheme:** Use a distinct and harmonious color palette for the pie slices. Select colors that are easily distinguishable but not jarring, such as a qualitative palette from a standard library like Matplotlib's 'Paired' or 'Set3'.\n5. **Refine Formatting:** For the new pie chart, avoid heavy borders or unnecessary background grids. Ensure text labels are legible and do not overlap. The overall design should be clean and focused on communicating the composition data effectively."
