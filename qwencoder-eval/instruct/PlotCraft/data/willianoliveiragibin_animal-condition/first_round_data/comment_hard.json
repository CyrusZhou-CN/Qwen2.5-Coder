    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address any part of the user's request. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n**1. Adhere to the Task Prompt:**\n   - **Layout:** Create a proper 3x3 subplot grid. Use a function like `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(3, 3)` to establish the correct structure.\n   - **Data:** The entire visualization must be based on data related to animal health and symptoms, as specified in the prompt.\n   - **Chart Types:** You must generate the nine specific, complex chart types requested for each subplot position. For example:\n     - **Subplot (0, 0):** A stacked bar chart overlaid with a line plot.\n     - **Subplot (0, 1):** A radar chart.\n     - **Subplot (0, 2):** A hierarchical clustering dendrogram combined with a heatmap.\n     - ...and so on for all nine subplots as detailed in the instruction.\n\n**2. Professional Formatting and Design:**\n   - **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background for the entire figure. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data.\n   - **Color Palette:** Replace the current clashing, neon colors with a professional and harmonious color scheme. Use colors purposefully to distinguish between categories or groups. Consider using a palette from a library like Seaborn or ColorBrewer.\n   - **Text and Labels:**\n     - Remove all the nonsensical, overlapping text overlays ('MAPPING TEXT CHAOS', etc.).\n     - Ensure all titles and axis labels are correct, descriptive of the data being shown, and relevant to the animal health theme.\n     - Establish a clear typographic hierarchy: make the main figure title and subplot titles larger and/or bolder than axis labels and tick labels.\n   - **Layout and Spacing:** Use functions like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to ensure there is adequate spacing between all subplots, preventing titles and labels from overlapping."
