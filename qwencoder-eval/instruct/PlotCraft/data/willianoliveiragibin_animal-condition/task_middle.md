Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the symptom composition patterns across different animal species. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a stacked bar chart showing the frequency distribution of the top 10 most common symptoms across all 5 symptom columns (symptoms1-5) for each animal species, and the bottom plot shows a pie chart revealing the overall proportion of each animal species in the dataset. Use different colors for each symptom type in the stacked bars and ensure proper legends and titles for both subplots.
