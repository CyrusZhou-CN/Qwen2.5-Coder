## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing animal health patterns and symptom clustering. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Animal-focused analysis):
1. Stacked bar chart showing symptom frequency distribution by animal type, overlaid with a line plot showing the total symptom count per animal
2. Radar chart comparing symptom profiles across different animal species, with each axis representing a different symptom category
3. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of animals based on their symptom similarity, combined with a heatmap showing symptom co-occurrence patterns

Middle row (Symptom network analysis):
4. Network graph showing symptom relationships and clustering patterns, overlaid with node size representing symptom frequency
5. Parallel coordinates plot showing symptom pathways for each animal, combined with density curves for each symptom dimension
6. Treemap visualization of symptom hierarchies by frequency, overlaid with scatter points showing symptom severity distribution

Bottom row (Pattern discovery):
7. Correlation heatmap of symptom co-occurrences across all animals, combined with marginal histograms showing individual symptom distributions
8. Cluster analysis scatter plot using dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE) of symptom patterns, overlaid with confidence ellipses for each animal group
9. Multi-level grouped bar chart showing symptom combinations by animal type, combined with box plots showing the distribution of symptom counts per combination

Each composite visualization should reveal different aspects of how symptoms cluster together, how animals group by their health patterns, and the underlying network relationships in the animal health data.
