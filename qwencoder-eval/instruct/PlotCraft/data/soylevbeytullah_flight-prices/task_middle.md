## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between flight duration and ticket prices across different airlines. Design a scatter plot with flight duration on the x-axis and price on the y-axis, where each point is colored by airline. Overlay this with a regression line showing the overall trend between duration and price. Additionally, add marginal histograms on the top and right sides of the main plot to show the distribution of flight duration and prices respectively.
