    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant improvements to meet professional standards and fulfill the task requirements. \n1. **Correct Data Mapping:** The most critical change is to remap the color aesthetic in the scatter plot (subplot at grid position (1,0)) to the 'airline' variable as specified in the prompt, instead of the current 'Class' variable.\n2. **Legend and Label Overhaul:** The legend is the biggest visual flaw. It must be completely fixed. Move the legend outside the plot area, for instance, to the right of the right-hand histogram, and ensure the text is rendered clearly without any overlap. The y-axis label for the right histogram (subplot (1,1)), 'Price Distribution', needs to be fixed so it is legible and properly oriented.\n3. **Add Missing Titles:** Add a clear, overarching title to the entire figure (e.g., 'Flight Price vs. Duration by Airline'). Also, add a specific title to the right histogram (subplot (1,1)), such as 'Price Distribution', to match the title on the top histogram.\n4. **Layout Adjustment:** Increase the spacing on the right side of the figure to create enough room for the right histogram, its labels, and a legible legend. This will resolve the current cramped appearance and overlap issues.\n5. **Enhance Text Hierarchy:** Make the main title larger and bolder than the subplot titles and axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
