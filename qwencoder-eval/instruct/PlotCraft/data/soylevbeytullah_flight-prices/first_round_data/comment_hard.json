    "improvement_suggestions": "To meet the task requirements and improve quality: \n1. **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** Add the required marginal histogram of prices along the y-axis.\n   - **Subplot (0, 2):** Correct the bubble chart. The color of the bubbles must be mapped to the 'airline' as specified in the legend. The size of the bubbles should represent the 'average price'.\n   - **Subplot (2, 1):** Add the hierarchical clustering dendrogram to the side of the correlation matrix heatmap.\n   - **Subplot (2, 2):** Re-implement this as a true 3D scatter plot with 'Price', 'Duration', and 'Stops' as the three distinct axes. The current 2D representation with offset axes is confusing and does not fulfill the requirement.\n\n2. **Visual Enhancements:**\n   - **Titles and Hierarchy:** Make all subplot titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy. For example, change the generic title 'Parallel Coordinates Plot' to something more descriptive like 'Flight Attributes by Airline'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** In subplot (2,1), increase the bottom margin to prevent the rotated x-axis labels from overlapping. In subplot (2,2), use clear and direct axis labels like 'Price (INR)', 'Duration (minutes)', and 'Number of Stops'.\n   - **Color Consistency:** Use a consistent color mapping for airlines across all relevant plots ((0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2)). For instance, if Jet Airways is blue in one plot, it should be blue in all plots.\n   - **Layout and Spacing:** Apply a tight layout adjustment (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)`) to increase the spacing between subplots and prevent titles and labels from feeling cramped.\n   - **Legend Placement:** Standardize legend placement. For plots like (1,2) and (2,2), placing the legend outside the plot area to the right is a good practice to avoid obscuring data points."
