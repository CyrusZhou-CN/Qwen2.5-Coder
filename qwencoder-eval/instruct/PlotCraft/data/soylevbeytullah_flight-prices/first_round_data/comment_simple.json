    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Chart Logic:** The most critical change is to fix the histogram's axes. The x-axis should represent 'Price in INR', and the y-axis should represent 'Frequency' or 'Number of Flights'.\n2. **Improve Binning:** The current binning is not informative. Adjust the number of bins (e.g., to 30 or 50) or the bin width to reveal the underlying shape of the price distribution, which is currently hidden in one large bar.\n3. **Revise All Text:**\n   - **Title:** Replace the incorrect titles with a single, clear title like 'Distribution of Flight Prices'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Change the x-axis label to 'Price in INR' and the y-axis label to 'Frequency'.\n   - **Annotation:** Replace the text 'Mean' on the vertical line with the actual mean value, formatted clearly (e.g., 'Mean Price: ₹XXXX'). Position this text horizontally next to the line for better readability.\n4. **Remove Extraneous Elements:** Delete the magenta circle and the 'Glarbnok' text, as they are irrelevant and distracting.\n5. **Enhance Professional Aesthetics:**\n   - **Color Scheme:** Adopt a professional color palette. Use a single, more subdued color (e.g., steel blue or dark gray) for the histogram bars and a distinct, contrasting color (e.g., dark red) for the mean line.\n   - **Background and Grid:** Change the chart style to use a white background with subtle, light gray gridlines to improve clarity and professionalism.\n   - **Layout:** Adjust the overall layout to remove the excessive white space at the top, allowing the plot area to be larger and more balanced within the figure."
