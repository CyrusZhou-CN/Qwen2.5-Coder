    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to be usable. The following critical changes are needed:\n1. **Remove the Artifact:** The most urgent issue is the complete removal of the thick, black, scribbled ring surrounding the pie chart. This appears to be a rendering error and makes the chart unusable.\n2. **Add Data Labels:** The chart is fundamentally failing its purpose without data labels. Add text labels to each pie slice. Each label must include the category name, the absolute count, and the calculated percentage as explicitly requested in the prompt (e.g., 'Category A\\n1,234 (15.2%)').\n3. **Ensure Title Clarity:** After removing the artifact, ensure the title 'Distribution of Plant Categories in Herbarium 2022 Training Dataset' is fully visible, centered above the chart, and not obstructed by any elements.\n4. **Consider a Legend:** If adding labels directly onto the slices makes the chart look cluttered (especially for smaller slices), an alternative is to add a legend that maps colors to category names and place only the percentages on the slices themselves."
