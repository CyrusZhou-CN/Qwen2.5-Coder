    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is attempting to visualize too many categories simultaneously. The entire approach needs to be rethought.\n\n1.  **Data Aggregation:** Before plotting, group the less frequent categories into a single 'Other' category. This is crucial for both plots.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Left Plot:**\n    *   Replace the current nested donut chart with a standard `pie chart` as requested.\n    *   Limit the pie chart to the top 5-7 most frequent categories and the 'Other' category to ensure it is readable.\n    *   Add percentage labels directly onto the pie slices for clarity, which would remove the need for a separate legend.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Right Plot:**\n    *   **Eliminate the Legend:** The current legend is the biggest flaw. A chart with hundreds of legend entries is never effective. The visualization strategy must be changed to not require it.\n    *   **Rethink the Visualization:** Instead of a stacked bar chart with categories, consider a different approach. For example, create a grouped bar chart showing the counts of the top 3-4 categories across the top 5 genera. This would result in a much cleaner and more comparable chart.\n    *   **Fix Text Overlap:** Rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees or switch to a horizontal bar chart (`plt.barh`) to make the genus IDs readable.\n    *   **Correct Title:** Ensure the data plotted matches the title. If the title says 'Top 5 Genera', then exactly five genera should be displayed on the x-axis.\n\n4.  **Overall Layout:**\n    *   After removing the massive legend, adjust the figure's aspect ratio and use `plt.tight_layout()` or equivalent to ensure the two subplots are well-proportioned and the overall image is balanced without excessive white space."
