## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the herbarium dataset structure and patterns. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Create a combined bar chart showing category distribution with an overlaid line plot indicating the cumulative percentage of samples, plus add error bars showing the standard deviation of genus_id within each category. (2) Top-right: Generate a hierarchical cluster dendrogram of image samples based on their genus_id and category features, overlaid with a scatter plot showing the relationship between image_id (as numeric) and category, colored by genus_id. (3) Bottom-left: Construct a violin plot showing the distribution of numeric image_id values grouped by category, combined with individual data points as a strip plot overlay and box plot statistics. (4) Bottom-right: Design a network-style visualization showing connections between categories and genus_id as nodes, with edge thickness representing frequency, combined with a parallel coordinates plot connecting image_id, genus_id, and category variables.
