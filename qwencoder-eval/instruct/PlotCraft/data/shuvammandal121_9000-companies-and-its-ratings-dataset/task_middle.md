# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between company ratings and review counts. First, create a scatter plot showing the correlation between ratings (y-axis) and review counts (x-axis), with points colored by company type (ctype). Then, overlay a regression line to show the overall trend. Additionally, add marginal histograms on the top and right sides of the scatter plot to show the distribution of review counts and ratings respectively. Note: You'll need to clean the review_count column by extracting numeric values from strings like "(59.9k Reviews)" and converting them to actual numbers.
