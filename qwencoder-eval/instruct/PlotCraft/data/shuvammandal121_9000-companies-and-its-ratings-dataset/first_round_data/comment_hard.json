    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul of its layout and corrections to several subplots to meet the prompt's requirements. \n1. **Overall Layout:** The most critical issue is spacing. Use a function like `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6, wspace=0.3)` to add significant vertical and horizontal space between all subplots. This will prevent titles, labels, and plots from overlapping.\n2. **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Re-implement as a stacked bar chart to show the proportion of employee sizes within each company type.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the current heatmap with a `seaborn.clustermap` to automatically include the required hierarchical clustering dendrograms on both axes.\n   - **Subplot (1, 2):** Replace the single scatter plot with a `seaborn.pairplot` to create the specified scatter plot matrix with marginal histograms.\n   - **Subplot (2, 1):** Modify the treemap to use a sequential colormap where the color intensity of each rectangle directly represents the average rating, and add a color bar for reference.\n3. **Text and Labels:**\n   - **Axis Labels (0, 0) & (0, 1):** Clean the data to create meaningful categories instead of 'Chennai + 64 more'. Rotate labels to 90 degrees or use a horizontal bar chart if names are long.\n   - **Axis Labels (1, 1):** Change 'years_num' to 'Company Age', 'ratings' to 'Rating', and 'review_count_num' to 'Review Count'.\n   - **Titles:** Make all titles more descriptive and accurate (e.g., change (1, 2) title to 'Pair Plot of Age, Rating, and Review Count'). Increase the font size of all titles and labels for better readability.\n4. **Color and Legends:**\n   - **Color Consistency:** Define a single color dictionary for 'Company Type' and apply it consistently across all relevant subplots ((0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2)).\n   - **Legend Placement:** Position legends to be less intrusive. For plots like (0, 2), consider placing the legend in a corner of the plot area (e.g., 'upper right') to avoid creating excessive white space.\n5. **Plot-Specific Refinements:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** The red line for 'Avg Rating' is visually jarring. Use a thinner line and a less prominent marker. Clearly label the secondary y-axis.\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** In the parallel coordinates plot, reduce the `alpha` (transparency) of the lines to better visualize density and trends."
