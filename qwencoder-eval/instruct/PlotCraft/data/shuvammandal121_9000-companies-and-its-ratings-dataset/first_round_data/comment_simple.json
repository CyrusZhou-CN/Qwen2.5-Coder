The generated charts do not address the user's prompt in any way.\n\nTo correct this, follow these steps:\n1.  **Discard Both Charts:** The pie chart and the bar chart are irrelevant and should be removed.\n2.  **Create a Single Histogram:** Generate a single (1x1 layout) histogram.\n3.  **Correct Data and Axes:** The histogram's x-axis must represent 'Ratings', and the y-axis must represent 'Frequency' (the count of companies within each rating bin).\n4.  **Set a Descriptive Title:** The chart title should accurately describe the content, for example, 'Distribution of Company Ratings'.\n5.  **Use Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background:** Use a standard white background.\n    *   **Colors:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., steel blue or gray) for the histogram bars. Avoid the current neon and high-contrast colors.\n    *   **Gridlines:** Add subtle, light-gray gridlines on the y-axis to aid in reading the frequency values. Remove the black background and white dashed lines.\n    *   **Text:** Ensure the title is bold and slightly larger than the axis labels for a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Bins:** Select a number of bins that effectively shows the shape of the data distribution.\n    *   **Remove Clutter:** Do not include irrelevant legends or excessively thick bar outlines."
