    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is completely unrelated to the task prompt and must be recreated from scratch. Follow these steps to fulfill the request:\n1.  **Discard the Current Chart:** The entire visualization is incorrect and cannot be salvaged.\n2.  **Use Correct Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single composite plot, often called a joint plot. This should consist of a central scatter plot with a histogram on the top x-axis and another histogram on the right y-axis. Libraries like Seaborn (`seaborn.jointplot`) are ideal for this.\n3.  **Implement Data Requirements:** \n    *   Plot 'ratings' on the y-axis and 'review counts' on the x-axis of the central scatter plot.\n    *   Color the points in the scatter plot according to the 'ctype' variable.\n    *   Overlay a regression line on the scatter plot to show the trend.\n    *   The top marginal histogram should show the distribution of 'review counts'.\n    *   The right marginal histogram should show the distribution of 'ratings'.\n4.  **Improve Formatting for Professionalism:**\n    *   Use a standard white background with light gray, non-distracting gridlines (or no gridlines).\n    *   Set a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Correlation between Company Rating and Review Count'.\n    *   Ensure axis labels ('Rating', 'Review Count') are clearly visible and correctly placed.\n    *   Include a legend to explain the color mapping for 'ctype'.\n    *   Ensure adequate spacing between all elements for a clean, uncluttered appearance."
