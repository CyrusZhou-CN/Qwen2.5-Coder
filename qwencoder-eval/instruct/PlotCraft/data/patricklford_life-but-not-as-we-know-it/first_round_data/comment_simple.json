The x-axis should represent the unemployment rate in percent. \n3. **Sorting:** The bars must be sorted in descending order, with the country having the highest unemployment rate positioned at the top of the chart. \n4. **Titles and Labels:** Add a clear main title, such as 'Top 15 Countries by Youth Unemployment Rate'. Label the x-axis 'Youth Unemployment Rate (%)' and the y-axis 'Country'. \n5. **Annotations:** Add data labels at the end of each horizontal bar, displaying the exact percentage value for that country. Ensure the text is legible and does not overlap with other elements. \n6. **Color Scheme:** To fulfill the 'different colors' requirement while maintaining professionalism, use a single hue with varying saturation (a sequential color palette) that darkens for higher unemployment rates. This is more effective than a random rainbow palette. \n7. **Professional Formatting:** Use a white background for clarity. Make gridlines subtle (light gray, thin) and run them vertically from the x-axis to help in reading values. Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the axis labels."
