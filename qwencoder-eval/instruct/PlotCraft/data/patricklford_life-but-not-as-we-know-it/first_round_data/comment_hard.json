    "improvement_suggestions": "1.  **General Layout:** Increase the vertical spacing between rows (e.g., using `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`) to prevent titles from crowding the plots above them.\n2.  **Subplot (0,0):** Implement the requested secondary y-axis for the moving average trendlines using `ax.twinx()` to clearly separate the raw CBR data from the smoothed trends.\n3.  **Subplot (0,2):** This plot needs a complete rework. The x-axis should represent 'Year'. The population growth rate should be a line chart, and the natural increase rate should be plotted as a bar chart on a secondary y-axis, as requested. The current implementation is unreadable and incorrect.\n4.  **Subplot (1,1):** Change the color of the top x-axis title ('Temperature Change (C)') from red to black for professional consistency.\n5.  **Subplot (1,2):** Add the 'Residual' component to the time series decomposition plot. Also, change the y-axis label from 'Value' to a more descriptive title (e.g., 'Indicator Value').\n6.  **Subplot (2,0):** Change the chart type from a simple bar chart to a 'stacked bar chart' as specified in the prompt, assuming the data structure allows for it.\n7.  **Subplot (2,2):** Modify the implementation to adhere to the prompt: display scatter plots only in the upper triangle of the matrix and the heatmap with correlation values in the lower triangle. This will de-clutter the visualization and make both the correlations and relationships easier to interpret.\n8.  **Text Formatting:** For subplots (2,0) and (2,1), rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees and set horizontal alignment to 'right' (`ha='right'`) to improve readability and prevent overlap. Increase the figure's bottom margin to provide adequate space for these labels."
