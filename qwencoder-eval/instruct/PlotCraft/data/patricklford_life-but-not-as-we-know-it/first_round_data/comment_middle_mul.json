    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's prompt. The following are steps to create the correct visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout**: Discard the current layout. Create a 2x2 subplot grid using a function like `plt.subplots(2, 2)`. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to ensure proper spacing between the four plots.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left (Diverging Bar Chart)**:\n    *   Plot countries on the y-axis and their deviation from the median land area below 5m on the x-axis.\n    *   Draw a vertical line at x=0 to represent the median.\n    *   Use two distinct, professional colors to represent bars for values above and below the median (e.g., muted blue for below, muted orange for above).\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Land Area Below 5m: Deviation from Global Median'.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right (Diverging Lollipop Chart)**:\n    *   Plot countries on the y-axis and their deviation from the average women's parliamentary representation on the x-axis.\n    *   Use the same two colors from the first plot to color the 'lollipops' (markers) for above/below average values to maintain consistency.\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Women in Parliament: Deviation from Global Average'.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left (Dumbbell Plot)**:\n    *   Plot countries on the y-axis and unemployment rate on the x-axis.\n    *   For each country, draw two points (one for the country's rate, one for the global benchmark) and connect them with a horizontal line.\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Youth Unemployment Rate vs. Global Benchmark'.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right (Error Bar Chart)**:\n    *   Plot continents/regions on the x-axis and land vulnerability percentage on the y-axis.\n    *   For each region, plot the average value and use error bars to show the deviation.\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Land Vulnerability: Deviation from Regional Averages'.\n\n6.  **Overall Formatting and Professionalism**:\n    *   **Background and Grid**: Use a white background for all subplots. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle.\n    *   **Color Palette**: Select a consistent and professional color palette for the entire figure. The prompt specifically requests consistent color coding to highlight performance across indicators.\n    *   **Typography**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy. Use a bold, larger font for a main figure title (e.g., 'Global Deviations in Key Survival Metrics') and slightly smaller, regular-weight fonts for subplot titles and axis labels.\n    *   **Clarity**: Ensure no text or data elements overlap. Adjust font sizes and label positions as needed for maximum readability."
