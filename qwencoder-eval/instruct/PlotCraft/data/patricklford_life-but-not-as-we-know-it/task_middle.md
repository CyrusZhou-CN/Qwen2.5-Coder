## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of global demographic patterns over time. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays overlapping line charts for Crude Birth Rate (CBR) and Crude Death Rate (CDR) trends from 1961-2021 for at least 5 major countries (China, India, United States, Germany, and Japan), with different colors for each country and line styles to distinguish CBR from CDR. The bottom plot should show the calculated natural population growth rate (CBR - CDR) as area charts for the same countries over the same time period, highlighting periods of demographic transition. Include proper legends, axis labels, and annotations to identify significant demographic events like China's Great Famine period (1959-1961) and demographic transitions in developed vs developing nations.
