# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals how different countries deviate from global patterns in three critical areas affecting humanity's survival. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left shows a diverging bar chart comparing each country's land area below 5m (climate vulnerability) against the global median, with bars extending left (below median) and right (above median) from a central axis; (2) Top-right displays a diverging lollipop chart showing how women's parliamentary representation in each country deviates from the global average, with different colors for above/below average performance; (3) Bottom-left presents a dumbbell plot comparing youth unemployment rates against a reference benchmark (global average), showing the gap between each country's rate and the benchmark; (4) Bottom-right creates an error bar chart showing the deviation of land vulnerability percentages from regional averages, grouped by continent/region. Use consistent color coding throughout all subplots to highlight countries that consistently perform above or below global benchmarks across multiple indicators.
