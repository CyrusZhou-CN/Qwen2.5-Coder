# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing global demographic and socioeconomic trends over time. Each subplot must combine multiple visualization techniques:

Row 1: Demographic Evolution Analysis
- Subplot 1: Overlay line charts showing Crude Birth Rate (CBR) trends from 1961-2021 for China, India, Morocco, and South Africa, with a secondary y-axis displaying a moving average trendline for each country
- Subplot 2: Combine Crude Death Rate (CDR) line charts with shaded confidence intervals (using standard deviation bands) for the same countries over the same period
- Subplot 3: Create a dual-axis plot showing population growth rate as line charts with overlaid bar charts representing the natural increase rate (CBR-CDR) for each country

Row 2: Climate and Environmental Impact
- Subplot 4: Display projected temperature changes (2045-2065) as both line plots and filled area charts, with error bars representing uncertainty ranges for countries with available data
- Subplot 5: Combine land area below 5m elevation (% of land area) as horizontal bar charts with overlaid scatter plots showing the correlation with projected temperature changes
- Subplot 6: Create a time series decomposition plot showing seasonal patterns in demographic indicators with trend lines and residual components

Row 3: Gender Equality and Economic Indicators
- Subplot 7: Merge stacked bar charts showing seats held by women in national parliaments with overlaid line plots displaying the global average trend
- Subplot 8: Combine youth unemployment rates as both violin plots (showing distribution) and box plots (showing quartiles) with country-specific trend lines
- Subplot 9: Create a correlation matrix heatmap overlaid with scatter plots in the upper triangle, showing relationships between all key indicators (CBR, CDR, women's parliamentary representation, youth unemployment)

Each subplot must include proper legends, axis labels, and use different color palettes to distinguish between countries and variables. Apply consistent styling across all subplots with a professional theme.
