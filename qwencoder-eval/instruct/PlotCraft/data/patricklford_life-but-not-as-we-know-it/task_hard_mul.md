# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing global demographic and socioeconomic trends over time. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (1,1): Create a dual-axis time series plot showing both Crude Birth Rate (CBR) and Crude Death Rate (CDR) trends from 1961-2021 for China, India, USA, and Germany. Use line plots for the rates with different colors, and overlay bar charts showing the natural increase (CBR-CDR) for each country. Add trend lines to highlight long-term patterns.

Top row (1,2): Develop a multi-layered area chart displaying CO2 emissions trends over time for the top 10 emitting countries, with an overlaid line plot showing global temperature change projections. Use stacked areas for emissions and a bold line with confidence bands for temperature projections.

Middle row (2,1): Construct a slope chart showing the change in women's parliamentary representation from lowest to highest values, combined with a scatter plot overlay where point sizes represent youth unemployment rates. Connect countries with slope lines and use color coding to represent different regions.

Middle row (2,2): Design a time series decomposition plot for population growth rates of major economies (USA, China, India, Germany, Japan) from 1961-2021. Show the original series, trend component, and seasonal/cyclical patterns as separate but aligned subplots within this single panel.

Bottom row (3,1): Create a correlation heatmap matrix showing relationships between birth rates, death rates, CO2 emissions, and economic indicators, overlaid with scatter plots in the lower triangle showing actual data points for key country pairs.

Bottom row (3,2): Develop a multi-timeline visualization combining line charts for demographic transition patterns (birth/death rate convergence) with ribbon/area charts showing the demographic dividend periods for different country groups (developed vs developing nations).
