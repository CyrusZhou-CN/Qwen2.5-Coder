# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that compares the operational parameters of faulty versus non-faulty industrial equipment. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot shows the deviation of equipment parameters (temperature, pressure, vibration, and humidity) from their respective means, with separate distributions for faulty and non-faulty equipment. Use diverging bar charts or violin plots to highlight how faulty equipment deviates from normal operational ranges, and include reference lines at the mean values to emphasize the deviations.
