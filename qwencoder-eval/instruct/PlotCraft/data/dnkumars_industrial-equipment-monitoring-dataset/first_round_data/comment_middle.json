    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart fails to meet the task requirements on a fundamental level and needs to be completely redone. \n1. **Layout and Chart Type:** Discard the current plots. Create a 2x2 subplot grid. For each subplot, use a violin plot to effectively show the distribution and deviation for faulty vs. non-faulty equipment. \n2. **Data Representation:**\n   - Subplot (0, 0): Violin plot for 'Temperature'. The x-axis should have two categories: 'Faulty' and 'Non-Faulty'. The y-axis should represent the 'Temperature Deviation from Mean'.\n   - Subplot (0, 1): Violin plot for 'Pressure'.\n   - Subplot (1, 0): Violin plot for 'Vibration'.\n   - Subplot (1, 1): Violin plot for 'Humidity'.\n3. **Reference Lines:** In each of the four subplots, add a horizontal dashed line at y=0 to clearly mark the mean, as requested. Example: `ax.axhline(0, color='gray', linestyle='--')`.\n4. **Text and Titles:** Replace all nonsensical labels with meaningful ones. Each subplot should have a clear title (e.g., 'Temperature Deviation'). The entire figure needs a main title, such as 'Deviation of Operational Parameters for Faulty vs. Non-Faulty Equipment'. Axis labels must be clear (e.g., 'Status' for the x-axis, 'Deviation from Mean' for the y-axis).\n5. **Color Scheme:** Use a professional, muted color palette. For instance, use a light blue for 'Non-Faulty' and a contrasting orange or red for 'Faulty' across all four subplots for consistency. Avoid the current neon colors.\n6. **Formatting:** Use a white background for a clean, professional look. If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and subtle. Ensure proper spacing between subplots to avoid any overlap using a function like `plt.tight_layout()`."
