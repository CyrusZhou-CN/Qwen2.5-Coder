    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete recreation. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the bar chart with a proper histogram to show the frequency distribution of a continuous variable (temperature).\n2. **Data Representation:** The x-axis must be a continuous numerical scale representing temperature. The data should be grouped into 15 bins as requested. The bars of the histogram should be contiguous.\n3. **Text Content:** All text must be replaced. \n    - **Title:** Use a clear and accurate title, such as 'Distribution of Temperature Readings Across Industrial Equipment'.\n    - **Axis Labels:** The x-axis label should be 'Temperature (°C)' and the y-axis label should be 'Frequency'.\n    - **Legend:** A legend is unnecessary for a single-series histogram and should be removed.\n4. **Remove Extraneous Elements:** The overlapping pie chart and its associated text must be completely removed.\n5. **Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    - **Background:** Use a standard white background for a professional look.\n    - **Color:** Replace the neon green with a more subdued, professional color like a standard blue or dark gray.\n    - **Gridlines:** Use subtle, light gray gridlines on the y-axis only to aid in reading values without distracting from the data.\n    - **Typography:** Make the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
