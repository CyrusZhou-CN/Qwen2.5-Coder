    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements and professional standards. \n1. **Layout Refinements:** The most critical issue is the layout. The entire figure needs to be regenerated using a proper grid layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `GridSpec`) to ensure all 9 subplots are arranged in a tight, evenly spaced 3x3 grid with consistent sizing. The excessive vertical white space must be eliminated.\n2. **Task Compliance Corrections:** Each subplot must be revised to match the prompt:\n   - **Subplot (0,0):** Add the required marginal histograms along the x and y axes.\n   - **Subplot (0,1):** Add text annotations to label clusters or representative points by equipment type.\n   - **Subplot (0,2):** Redesign as a proper correlation heatmap. The y-axis should list the sensor variables ('temperature', 'pressure', etc.), not concatenated labels. The segmentation by equipment type should be clearer, perhaps by creating three small heatmaps within this subplot's space.\n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Replace the single scatter plot with a scatter plot matrix (pairplot) showing the pairwise relationships between temperature, pressure, and vibration.\n   - **Subplot (1,1):** The plot should show separate violin plots for *each sensor type*, grouped by location on the x-axis. The required box plots and individual data points should be overlaid on the violins.\n   - **Subplot (1,2):** The radar chart must be reconfigured to compare locations. Each polygon should represent a location, not a fault status.\n   - **Subplot (2,0):** In addition to coloring lines by fault status, use different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) to represent the different equipment types.\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** This needs to be a combined plot. The dendrogram should cluster equipment *instances* (not sensors), and a corresponding correlation matrix of these instances should be displayed alongside it. Add annotations for fault status.\n3. **Text and Formatting Improvements:**\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** Fix the overlapping y-axis tick labels by reducing their density or font size.\n   - **Subplot (0,2):** Correct the y-axis labels to be meaningful.\n   - **General:** Standardize font sizes and weights across all subplots for a consistent visual hierarchy. Ensure all legends are clear and do not obstruct data."
