Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid to explore the relationships between audio features across different music genres. In the top-left subplot, create a correlation heatmap showing the correlation coefficients between all numerical audio features (danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) for all genres combined. In the top-right subplot, create a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) focusing on the three most correlated feature pairs identified from the heatmap, with different colors representing different genres. In the bottom-left subplot, create a bubble plot showing the relationship between energy and valence, where bubble size represents popularity and colors represent different genres. In the bottom-right subplot, create a violin plot overlaid with strip plots showing the distribution of the acousticness feature across all seven genres, revealing how this key audio characteristic varies between musical styles.
