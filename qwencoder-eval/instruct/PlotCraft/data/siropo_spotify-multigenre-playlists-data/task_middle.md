# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left subplot, display a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between all audio features (danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) across all genres combined. In the top-right subplot, create a scatter plot with best fit line showing the relationship between energy and loudness, with points colored by genre. In the bottom-left subplot, generate a bubble plot examining the relationship between danceability and valence, where bubble size represents popularity and colors represent different genres. In the bottom-right subplot, create a pair plot focusing on the three most correlated audio features identified from the heatmap, with different colors for each genre. Each subplot should include appropriate titles, legends, and annotations to highlight the strongest correlations discovered.
