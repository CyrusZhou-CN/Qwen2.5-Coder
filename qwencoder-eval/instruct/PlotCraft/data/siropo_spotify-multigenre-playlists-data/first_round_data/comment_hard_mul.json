    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, first and foremost, adhere to the task prompt: (1) Correct the layout to 3x2. (2) Add the missing components: marginal histograms to subplot (0,0), overlaid box plots to (0,1), and a dendrogram to (0,2). (3) Remove the unrequested stacked bar chart. (4) In the network graph (1,1), change the node color encoding to represent the 'dominant audio feature' and add a corresponding legend. \n\nFor visual and quality enhancements: \n1. **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the vertical space between the main title and the top row of subplots to eliminate overlap. Use a layout manager like `tight_layout` to ensure consistent, adequate spacing between all elements. \n2. **Legends:** Add the missing genre legend to the scatter plot (0,0). Standardize legend placement for a cleaner look, for example, by creating a single, shared legend for the entire figure on the right side. Ensure legend labels are consistent (e.g., use 'Metal' everywhere, not 'Metal Mean').\n3. **Clarity:** In the parallel coordinates plot (0,1), significantly decrease the alpha (transparency) of the thin lines for individual tracks to de-emphasize them and make the bold mean lines stand out. In the radar chart (1,0), reduce the alpha of the filled polygons so that overlapping shapes and the grid/points underneath are visible.\n4. **Text:** Shorten or rephrase the main title to prevent awkward wrapping and overlap. For plots with rotated labels like the heatmap (0,2), consider transposing the axes to a horizontal bar chart or heatmap if it improves label readability."
