    "improvement_suggestions": "The most significant issue is the failure to follow the prompt's core instruction. The chart should be redrawn as a single histogram with multiple, overlapping, semi-transparent distributions, accompanied by a legend to identify the genres.\n\nHowever, to improve the *existing faceted chart*, consider the following:\n1.  **Layout Refinement:** Rearrange the 7 subplots into a more balanced grid, such as a 4x2 layout, to eliminate the large empty space and create a more compact and visually appealing composition.\n2.  **Title Formatting:** Center the main title ('Distribution of Energy Level Across Music Genres') above the entire grid of plots. Increase its font size and apply a bold weight to establish a clear visual hierarchy. This will also resolve the current overlap with the subplot titles at positions (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).\n3.  **Typographic Hierarchy:** Change the font weight of the subplot titles (e.g., 'Metal (n=3,045)') and the y-axis labels ('Frequency') from bold to regular. This will make the main title the primary focal point and give the chart a more professional and less cluttered appearance.\n4.  **Axis Label Consistency:** For a cleaner design, use shared axis labels. Place a single 'Energy Level' label centered below the bottom row of plots and a single 'Frequency' label centered to the left of the entire grid."
