    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet the task requirements for composite charts. The following suggestions address both task compliance and visual quality:\n\n1.  **Implement Composite Visualizations**: The most critical change is to rebuild each subplot as requested.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Add marginal density plots along the top and right axes.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1)**: Overlay semi-transparent box plots on the radar chart for each feature to show the distribution, not just the mean profile.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2)**: Replace the standalone dendrogram with a single clustermap visualization, where the dendrogram is attached to a heatmap of audio feature correlations.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Add a regression/trend line for each genre to the bubble chart.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: Overlay a strip plot (with jitter) on top of the violin plots to show individual data points.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 2)**: Replace the heatmap entirely with the requested network graph, where nodes are genres and edges represent feature similarity.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: Add density curves along each vertical axis.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: Add marginal histograms to the top and right axes, overlay the original scatter points, and add genre-specific contour lines.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2)**: Add a silhouette analysis bar chart next to or below the K-Means scatter plot.\n\n2.  **Enhance Color Scheme**: \n    *   Establish a single, consistent, and colorblind-friendly color palette for the genres. Apply this palette to all relevant subplots: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), the nodes in the new network graph (1,2), and the overlaid points/contours in (2,1).\n    *   Improve the distinction between 'Pop' and 'Rock' by using more distinct colors (e.g., orange and red, or yellow and orange).\n    *   For the K-Means plot (2,2), find a way to relate the clusters back to the original genres. For example, use color for the cluster ID and different marker shapes for the original genre of each point.\n\n3.  **Improve Clarity and Layout**:\n    *   In the Parallel Coordinates plot (2,0), significantly decrease the opacity of the individual track lines (e.g., alpha=0.1) to reduce clutter and emphasize the thicker average-value lines.\n    *   Reposition the legend in subplot (2,1) to prevent it from overlapping the color bar. Place it outside the plot area if necessary.\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between the rows of subplots (e.g., using `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)`) to give the titles more breathing room."
