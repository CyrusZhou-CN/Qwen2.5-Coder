    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to plot the actual histogram data for the energy levels of each music genre; the chart is currently empty. The y-axis must be corrected: it is labeled 'Frequency' but displays negative values, which is impossible. The y-axis range should be adjusted to start from 0 and extend to an appropriate maximum value based on the data. When plotting the data, apply a transparency (alpha) value (e.g., 0.5) to each genre's histogram as requested in the prompt, which will help in visualizing overlapping distributions. For better professional formatting, make the main title 'Distribution of Energy Levels Across Music Genres' bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
