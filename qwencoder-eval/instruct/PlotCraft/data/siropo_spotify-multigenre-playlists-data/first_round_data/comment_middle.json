    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Chart Type**: Replace the scatter plot in subplot (1, 1) with a `seaborn.pairplot` to correctly visualize the relationships between the three most correlated features (energy, loudness, acousticness) as requested.\n2. **Resolve Overplotting**: Address the severe data overlap in subplots (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) by significantly reducing the marker size and/or increasing transparency (alpha). For the bubble plot (1, 0), rescale the bubble sizes to ensure smaller bubbles remain visible and larger ones do not obscure the entire plot.\n3. **Fix Layout and Titling**: Create a single, centered main title for the entire figure using `fig.suptitle()` for a professional and clear hierarchy. The current title is confusingly split. Increase the horizontal and vertical spacing between subplots (e.g., `subplots_adjust(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.4)`) to improve readability and reduce the cramped appearance.\n4. **Correct Text and Annotations**: In the text box in subplot (1, 0), correct the correlation values to reflect the negative relationships shown in the data: 'energy <> acousticness (r=-0.686)' and 'loudness <> acousticness (r=-0.532)'. Move this text box to a less obtrusive position, such as below the plot, to avoid overlapping with axis labels.\n5. **Consolidate Legends**: Since the same color-to-genre mapping is used in three plots, replace the individual legends with a single, consolidated legend for the entire figure. Place it to the right of the 2x2 grid to save space and reduce redundancy.\n6. **Clean Axis Labels**: In the heatmap (0, 0), remove the trailing hyphens from the y-axis tick labels (e.g., change 'danceability -' to 'danceability') for a cleaner presentation."
