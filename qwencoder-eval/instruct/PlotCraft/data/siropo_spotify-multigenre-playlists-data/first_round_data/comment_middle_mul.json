    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet a key task requirement and a major data representation error. \n1.  **Correct the Chart Type in Subplot (0,1):** Replace the current single scatter plot with the requested scatter plot matrix (pair plot). This matrix should visualize the relationships between the three feature pairs with the highest absolute correlation values from the heatmap: (Loudness vs. Energy), (Acousticness vs. Energy), and (Acousticness vs. Loudness). Ensure the points in each scatter plot are colored by genre, consistent with the legend.\n2.  **Fix the X-Axis in Subplot (1,1):** The x-axis of the 'Acousticness Distribution' plot is incorrect. It must be changed to a continuous scale representing the actual acousticness values, which typically range from 0.0 to 1.0. The current integer scale is misleading and must be corrected to accurately reflect the data distribution.\n3.  **Enhance Color Distinguishability:** In the legends for subplots (0,1) and (1,0), the colors for 'Indie/Alt' (light teal) and 'Rock' (light green) are very similar. Adjust one of these colors to a more distinct hue to improve readability for all viewers.\n4.  **Add a Bubble Size Legend:** In the bubble plot (1,0), add a legend for the bubble sizes to clarify the relationship between size and the 'Popularity' metric. For example, display three sample bubbles of increasing size labeled with corresponding popularity values (e.g., '25', '50', '75').\n5.  **Improve Title Spacing:** Increase the vertical padding between the main figure title ('Comprehensive Audio Features...') and the titles of the top-row subplots to create a clearer visual separation and improve the overall layout hierarchy."
