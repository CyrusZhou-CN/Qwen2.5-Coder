## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 countries by total electricity production value in December 2023. Sort the countries from highest to lowest production values, with the country names on the y-axis and production values on the x-axis. Add appropriate labels, title, and format the x-axis values to show units in GWh. Use a color scheme that makes the highest producing country stand out from the rest.
