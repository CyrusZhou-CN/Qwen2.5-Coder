Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the electricity production composition across different countries. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top subplot displays a stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of electricity production by product type for each country, and the bottom subplot shows a pie chart focusing on the overall global composition of electricity production across all product types. Use different colors for each product type and ensure both charts share the same color scheme for consistency.
