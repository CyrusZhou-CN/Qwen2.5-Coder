# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing global electricity production trends and patterns. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Line chart with error bands showing total electricity production over time for top 5 producing countries, overlaid with scatter points for monthly peaks; (2) Top-center: Stacked area chart showing the composition of electricity sources (renewable vs fossil fuels) over time, with a secondary line plot showing the renewable energy percentage trend; (3) Top-right: Slope chart comparing production values between 2010 and 2023 for all countries, with diverging color coding based on growth/decline; (4) Middle-left: Time series decomposition plot showing seasonal patterns in electricity production with trend and residual components; (5) Middle-center: Calendar heatmap displaying monthly production intensity across years, overlaid with box plots showing seasonal distribution; (6) Middle-right: Autocorrelation and cross-correlation plot examining temporal dependencies in production data; (7) Bottom-left: Multi-line time series with confidence intervals showing production volatility patterns across different energy sources; (8) Bottom-center: Seasonal plot with polar coordinates showing cyclical patterns, combined with violin plots for each season; (9) Bottom-right: Time series with multiple y-axes showing both absolute production values and year-over-year growth rates, with highlighted recession/growth periods.
