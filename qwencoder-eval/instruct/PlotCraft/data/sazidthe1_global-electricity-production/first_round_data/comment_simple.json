Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality chart:\n1.  **Start Over:** Discard the current pie chart and scatter plot.\n2.  **Chart Type & Layout:** Create a single subplot (1x1 layout) using a horizontal bar chart (`matplotlib.pyplot.barh`).\n3.  **Data & Sorting:** Plot the data for the top 10 countries by electricity production. Ensure the bars are sorted in descending order, with the country with the highest production at the top.\n4.  **Axes & Labels:**\n    *   The y-axis should list the names of the top 10 countries.\n    *   The x-axis should represent the production value. Label it 'Electricity Production (GWh)'.\n    *   Set a clear, descriptive title, such as 'Top 10 Countries by Electricity Production in December 2023'.\n5.  **Color Scheme:** To fulfill the requirement of making the highest producer stand out, use a neutral color (e.g., light gray or steel blue) for the bars of countries ranked 2-10, and a distinct, saturated color (e.g., a darker blue or orange) for the bar of the #1 ranked country.\n6.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Set the chart background to white.\n    *   If using gridlines, make them subtle (light gray, thin) and apply them only along the x-axis to aid in reading values.\n    *   Remove the top and right chart borders (spines) for a cleaner look.\n    *   Establish a visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
