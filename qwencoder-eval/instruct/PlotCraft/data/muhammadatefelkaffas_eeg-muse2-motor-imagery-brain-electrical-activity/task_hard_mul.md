## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing EEG brainwave patterns and motor imagery classification across multiple subjects. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

1. **Top Left**: Create a cluster analysis plot combining a scatter plot of Alpha vs Beta power bands (colored by subject) with overlaid density contours and marginal histograms showing the distribution patterns across different motor imagery states.

2. **Top Right**: Design a parallel coordinates plot showing the five brainwave bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) for each electrode position (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10), with lines colored by concentration levels and overlaid with box plots at each coordinate axis.

3. **Middle Left**: Construct a correlation network graph where nodes represent different electrode-brainwave combinations and edges show correlation strengths, combined with a correlation heatmap as background and hierarchical clustering dendrogram on the side.

4. **Middle Right**: Build a radar chart comparing average brainwave patterns across different subjects, overlaid with individual subject trajectories and combined with a grouped bar chart showing statistical significance tests between groups.

5. **Bottom Left**: Create a time-series decomposition plot showing raw EEG signals from multiple electrodes over time, combined with spectral analysis plots and cross-correlation matrices between electrode pairs.

6. **Bottom Right**: Design a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot showing subject groupings based on their EEG signatures, combined with a dendrogram showing hierarchical relationships and overlaid confidence ellipses for different motor imagery classes.

Use at least 5 different CSV files from the dataset, ensure proper color coding for different subjects and motor imagery states, and include statistical annotations showing significant differences between groups.
