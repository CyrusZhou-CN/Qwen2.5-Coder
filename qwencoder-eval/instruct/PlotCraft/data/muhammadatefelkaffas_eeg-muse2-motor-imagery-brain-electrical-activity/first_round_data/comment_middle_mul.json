    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally broken as it fails to plot any data in three of the four subplots and uses the wrong chart type in the fourth. The primary suggestion is to fix the data plotting implementation.\n\n1.  **Data Plotting:** The most critical issue is the complete absence of data in subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0). The code must be corrected to render the heatmap cells, scatter plot points, and bubbles.\n2.  **Chart Type Correction:** In subplot (0, 1), replace the single scatter plot with the requested scatter plot matrix (pair plot) to show the relationships between all Beta band measurements.\n3.  **Network Plot Overhaul (1, 1):**\n    *   **Fix Overlap:** Implement a network layout algorithm (e.g., `spring_layout` or `circular_layout`) to position the nodes so they and their labels are clearly visible and do not overlap.\n    *   **Add Edges:** The plot is missing its most important feature: the edges representing correlations. Draw edges between nodes where the absolute correlation is > 0.3.\n    *   **Vary Edge Thickness:** The thickness of each edge should be proportional to the strength of the correlation it represents.\n4.  **Fulfill Specific Requirements:**\n    *   In subplot (0, 0), add the numerical correlation coefficients as annotations inside each cell of the heatmap.\n    *   In subplot (0, 1), once it is a pair plot, add regression lines for each concentration group as requested.\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), ensure the bubble sizes are correctly scaled to represent the Gamma band average.\n5.  **Layout Refinement:** Reduce the large vertical whitespace between the two rows of subplots to create a more compact and visually integrated figure. This can be achieved using `plt.tight_layout()` or by manually adjusting subplot spacing parameters."
