The suggestions below outline how to create the correct chart.\n\n1.  **Chart Type:** Replace the four pie charts with a single histogram. To compare the four electrode positions, you can either overlay the four histograms on the same axes using different colors and transparency (alpha) or create a 2x2 grid of histograms (one for each electrode) with shared axes for direct comparison.\n2.  **Data and Content:** The chart must plot the distribution of 'Alpha brainwave power' from the specified dataset. All current data and text are incorrect and must be replaced.\n3.  **Title and Labels:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Change to 'Distribution of Alpha Brainwave Power by Electrode Position'.\n    *   **X-Axis Label:** Change to 'Alpha Power (e.g., µV²)' or another appropriate unit for power spectral density.\n    *   **Y-Axis Label:** Change to 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n4.  **Legend:** Implement a single, clear legend that maps each color to the corresponding electrode name (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10). The current legend in subplot (1, 1) is nonsensical and should be removed.\n5.  **Color Scheme:** Use a professional and visually distinct color palette for the four distributions. Avoid the current jarring neon colors. Consider a colorblind-friendly palette.\n6.  **Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for a clean, professional look.\n    *   If using gridlines, make them light gray and unobtrusive.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the axis labels."
