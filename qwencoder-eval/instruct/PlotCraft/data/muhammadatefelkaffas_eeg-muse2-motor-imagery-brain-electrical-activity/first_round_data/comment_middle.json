    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is task non-compliance. To fix this:\n1.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Chart Type:** Replace the current single scatter plot with the requested scatter plot matrix (pair plot). This matrix should visualize the relationships between all Alpha and Beta band features across the four electrodes (e.g., Alpha_TP9, Alpha_AF7, Beta_TP9, Beta_AF7, etc.), with points colored by 'Concentration Level'.\n2.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Visualization Requirement:** Complete the network plot by adding edges (lines) between the nodes. The thickness of each edge should be proportional to the absolute correlation strength (|r|), and the color should indicate the sign of the correlation (e.g., red for positive, blue for negative, as suggested by the title).\n3.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Text Clarity:** Correct the colorbar label from 'Beta_TP9 Activity' to 'Correlation Coefficient' to accurately describe the data being represented.\n4.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Text Formatting:** For a cleaner appearance, remove the trailing hyphens from the tick labels on both the x and y axes (e.g., change 'Delta_TP9 -' to 'Delta_TP9').\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Layout Refinement:** Move the legend closer to the plot area to reduce the large amount of empty white space on the right side, creating a more compact and balanced composition."
