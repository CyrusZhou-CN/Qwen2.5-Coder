    "improvement_suggestions": "To meet the task requirements and improve quality, the following changes are essential: \n1. **Correct All Text Content**: \n   - Change the main title to 'Distribution of Alpha Brainwave Power'. \n   - Change the subplot titles to the corresponding electrode names: 'TP9' for subplot (0, 0), 'AF7' for (0, 1), 'AF8' for (1, 0), and 'TP10' for (1, 1). \n   - Change the x-axis label on the bottom plots to 'Alpha Power (µV²)' or another appropriate unit. \n   - Change the y-axis label on the left plots to 'Frequency' or 'Count'. \n   - Remove the incorrect and redundant legends from all subplots. The subplot titles are sufficient for identification. \n2. **Adopt Professional Formatting**: \n   - Switch to a standard publication style with a white background. \n   - Use subtle, light gray gridlines instead of the bright white ones. \n   - Ensure axis lines and ticks are black or dark gray. \n   - Establish a clear text hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis and subplot titles. \n3. **Improve Color Scheme**: \n   - Replace the current neon colors with a professional, visually appealing palette. Consider using a single color with varying shades for all subplots for consistency, or a qualitative palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer's 'Set2' or 'Paired') if distinct colors are preferred."
