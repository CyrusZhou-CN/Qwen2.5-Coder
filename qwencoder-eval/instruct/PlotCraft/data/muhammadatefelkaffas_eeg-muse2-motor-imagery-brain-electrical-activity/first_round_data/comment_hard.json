    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to adhere to the task prompt. The chart must be regenerated to include the correct chart types and components.\n\n**Task Compliance Corrections:**\n1.  **Subplot (0,1):** Add the hierarchical clustering dendrogram. It should be placed alongside the heatmap to show how the electrodes are grouped based on the correlation data.\n2.  **Subplot (0,2):** Replace the violin plot with a parallel coordinates plot. Each line should represent an electrode, and the vertical axes should represent the frequency bands.\n3.  **Subplot (1,0):** Re-implement as a network graph where nodes are frequency bands. Edges must be drawn between nodes, with edge thickness or color representing the correlation strength. This network should be overlaid on a background that is a correlation matrix heatmap, not a simple colored rectangle.\n4.  **Subplot (1,2):** Add marginal box plots to the top and right axes of the bubble plot to show the distributions of Theta and Gamma power independently.\n5.  **Subplot (2,0):** Add shaded confidence bands around the time series lines for each cluster. Also, use distinct line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) in addition to color to differentiate the clusters, improving accessibility.\n6.  **Subplot (2,2):** Replace the single scatter plot with a 3x3 scatter plot matrix (pairplot) to show the pairwise relationships between 'Mellow', 'Concentration', and 'Alpha Ratio'. Each off-diagonal plot should be a scatter plot, and each diagonal plot should show the distribution (e.g., a histogram or KDE) of a single variable.\n\n**Visual Quality Enhancements:**\n1.  **Layout & Spacing:** Increase the `hspace` and `wspace` between subplots to give the elements more room to breathe and improve readability. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or a similar function to ensure all labels and titles fit without being cut off.\n2.  **Clarity & Overplotting:** In the scatter/bubble plots at (0,0) and (1,2), reduce the `alpha` transparency of the markers to better reveal the density of overlapping points. Alternatively, consider using a 2D histogram or hexbin plot for these dense datasets.\n3.  **Color Cohesion:** Establish a consistent color map for the entire figure. For example, 'Alpha' should be the same color in subplot (2,0) and (2,1). The four electrodes (TP9, AF7, etc.) should use the same distinct colors in every plot where they appear.\n4.  **Text & Titles:** Use a single, prominent main title for the entire 3x3 grid (a `suptitle`). Then, use shorter, more descriptive titles for each individual subplot. Increase the font size of all axis labels, tick labels, and legends by 1-2 points for better legibility."
