# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the relationships between roasting machine temperature sensors and production quality. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining scatter plots with regression lines and marginal distribution plots. The grid should be organized as follows: Row 1 - Chamber 1 sensors (T_data_1_1, T_data_1_2, T_data_1_3) vs quality; Row 2 - Chamber 2 sensors (T_data_2_1, T_data_2_2, T_data_2_3) vs quality; Row 3 - Chamber 3 sensors (T_data_3_1, T_data_3_2, T_data_3_3) vs quality. For each subplot, overlay the scatter plot with a polynomial regression line (degree 2), add marginal histograms on the top and right sides showing the distribution of each variable, include correlation coefficients as text annotations, and use different colors for each chamber. Additionally, create a color-coded correlation heatmap as a background reference in the center of the entire figure.
