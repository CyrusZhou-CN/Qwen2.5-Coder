# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization to analyze the relationship between roasting machine temperature patterns and product quality. First, create a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between all temperature sensors (T_data_1_1 through T_data_5_3) and the quality measurements. Second, overlay this with a scatter plot that specifically highlights the strongest temperature-quality correlation, including a best-fit line and confidence intervals. Use different color schemes for each visualization component to clearly distinguish the heatmap from the scatter plot overlay.
