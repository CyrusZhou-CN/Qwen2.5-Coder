    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the following actions are required:\n1.  **Fulfill Task Requirements:** The highest priority is to add the missing marginal histograms to the top and right of each of the 8 scatter plots. The heatmap in subplot (2, 0) must be removed and replaced with the correct scatter plot for 'Chamber 3: T_data_3_1' vs 'Quality'. If the heatmap is to be included, it should replace the center subplot (1, 1) as a more logical interpretation of the prompt, or be removed entirely to focus on the primary analysis.\n2.  **Eliminate Overlap:** Increase the vertical spacing between the main figure title and the top row of subplots to resolve the major overlap. This can be done using `fig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0, 1, 0.95])` or by manually setting the `y` position of the `suptitle`.\n3.  **Optimize Legend Placement:** Move the legend in subplot (0, 2) from its current position where it overlaps data to 'upper left' or, for a cleaner design, create a single figure-level legend outside the grid of plots.\n4.  **Improve Layout and Axis Labeling:** To de-clutter the grid, share axes. The y-axis label 'Quality' should only be displayed on the leftmost column of subplots ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)). Similarly, the x-axis titles should only be displayed on the bottom row of subplots ((2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)). This is standard practice for professional grid-based visualizations.\n5.  **Correct Textual Errors:** Remove the conflicting titles on subplot (2, 0). Each subplot should have a single, clear, and correct title."
