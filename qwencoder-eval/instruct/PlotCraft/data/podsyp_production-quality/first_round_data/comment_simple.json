    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the scatter plot with a histogram. The purpose is to show the frequency distribution of a single variable (product quality), for which a histogram is the correct chart type.\n2. **Data Mapping:** The x-axis of the histogram should represent the 'Product Quality' values, and the y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Count' of observations within each bin.\n3. **Labels and Title:**\n   - Change the main title to 'Distribution of Product Quality from Roasting Machine'.\n   - Set the x-axis label to 'Product Quality'.\n   - Set the y-axis label to 'Frequency'.\n4. **Remove Annotations:** Delete all current annotations, including the pie chart with 'A', 'B', 'C', the text 'Glarbnok's Revenge', and the red box with 'Quality?'. These are distracting and unprofessional.\n5. **Color Scheme:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a standard blue or gray) for the histogram bars. This will create a clean and professional look.\n6. **Formatting:**\n   - Use a white background for the chart.\n   - If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines) and only on the y-axis to aid in reading the frequency values.\n   - Ensure the title is bolded and has a slightly larger font size than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
