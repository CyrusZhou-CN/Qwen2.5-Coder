    "improvement_suggestions": "To significantly improve this chart, a complete layout change is necessary. Instead of an overlay, use a 1x2 subplot layout.\n\n1.  **Layout Refinement:** Create a figure with two subplots side-by-side. Place the heatmap in subplot (0, 0) and the scatter plot in subplot (0, 1). This will eliminate all overlap issues and create a clean, professional presentation.\n2.  **Heatmap Correction:** The most critical fix is to regenerate the heatmap to include the 'Quality' variable as the last row and column. This is essential to meet the core task requirement.\n3.  **Element Positioning and Removal:** Remove the separate text box on the right ('Quality Correlations'). This information will be directly and more effectively communicated within the corrected heatmap.\n4.  **Text Formatting Improvements:**\n    *   Provide a clear, overarching title for the entire figure, such as 'Temperature Sensor Correlation with Product Quality'.\n    *   Give each subplot its own concise title (e.g., 'Correlation Matrix' and 'Strongest Correlation: T_data_3_3 vs. Quality').\n    *   In the scatter plot legend (subplot (0, 1)), reformat the p-value to be more readable, for instance, 'p < 0.001'.\n5.  **Professional Standards and Color:**\n    *   Ensure both subplots use a consistent, professional style. The scatter plot (subplot (0, 1)) should have a white background to match the heatmap.\n    *   If gridlines are used in the scatter plot, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines).\n    *   To improve distinction, change the color of the scatter plot elements (points, line, confidence interval) to a color not used in the heatmap, such as blue or green."
