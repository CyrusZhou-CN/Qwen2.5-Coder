# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between YouTube channel engagement metrics and subscriber count. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a scatter plot of Subscribers vs Likes with points colored by Categories, and the bottom plot displays a scatter plot of Subscribers vs Comments with points sized by Visits. Include trend lines for both scatter plots to highlight correlation patterns, and ensure proper data type conversion for numerical columns that are currently stored as strings with comma separators.
