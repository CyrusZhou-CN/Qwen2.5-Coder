It must be discarded and recreated from scratch.\n\n1.  **Start Over:** Create a new visualization with a single 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Correct Chart Type and Data:** Generate a single histogram using the specified YouTube dataset. The histogram should visualize the distribution of the 'Suscribers' column.\n3.  **Adhere to Data Processing Instructions:** Ensure the 'Suscribers' column is converted to a numeric type and that the histogram is created with 20 bins.\n4.  **Implement Correct Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Subscriber Counts for Top 1000 YouTubers'.\n    *   **X-axis Label:** Label the x-axis 'Subscriber Count (in millions)'. The tick values should be scaled accordingly (e.g., a value of 50,000,000 should be displayed as '50').\n    *   **Y-axis Label:** Label the y-axis 'Number of Channels' or 'Frequency'.\n5.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Use a standard white background with dark gray or black text for readability. The histogram bars should be a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue or gray).\n    *   **Gridlines:** If gridlines are necessary, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines) and placed behind the data bars.\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title should be bold and slightly larger than the axis labels. All text should be legible and free of overlap."
