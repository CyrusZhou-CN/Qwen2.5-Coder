Follow these steps to comply with the original task:\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x1 subplot layout (two rows, one column).\n2.  **Top Subplot (0, 0):**\n    *   Change the chart type to a scatter plot.\n    *   Set the x-axis to 'Subscribers' and the y-axis to 'Likes'.\n    *   Color the data points according to the 'Categories' column.\n    *   Add a legend to explain the color mapping for the categories.\n    *   Add a linear regression trend line.\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Correlation between Subscribers and Likes by Category'.\n3.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0):**\n    *   Change the chart type to a scatter plot.\n    *   Set the x-axis to 'Subscribers' and the y-axis to 'Comments'.\n    *   Size the data points according to the 'Visits' column.\n    *   Add a linear regression trend line.\n    *   Set a clear title, such as 'Correlation between Subscribers and Comments (Sized by Visits)'.\n4.  **General Formatting:**\n    *   Use a professional and clean theme with a white background, dark gray text, and subtle gridlines.\n    *   Remove all nonsensical titles and the overlapping yellow text box.\n    *   Ensure all text, including axis labels, tick labels, and titles, is correct, legible, and does not overlap with other chart elements.\n    *   Adjust the spacing between the two subplots to ensure a balanced and clear presentation."
