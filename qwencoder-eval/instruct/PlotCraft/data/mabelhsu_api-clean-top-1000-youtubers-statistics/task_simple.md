# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of YouTube channel subscriber counts across the top 1000 YouTubers dataset. Convert the 'Suscribers' column from string format (with commas) to numeric values, then create a histogram with 20 bins to visualize how subscriber counts are distributed among these top channels. Include appropriate axis labels, a title, and ensure the x-axis shows subscriber counts in millions for better readability.
