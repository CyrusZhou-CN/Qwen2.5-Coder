    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, a complete re-implementation of most subplots is necessary to meet the task requirements. \n1.  **Global**: Establish a consistent theme for all plots, including uniform font sizes for titles, axis labels, and tick labels. Add a single, overarching title for the entire 3x3 figure.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1)**: Re-create this as a proper grouped violin plot. The x-axis should represent 'Maintenance Cost', and within each category, display separate violin plots for each 'Safety' level. Crucially, overlay a box plot on each violin to show summary statistics as requested.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0)**: This parallel coordinates plot needs the requested density curves. Add small density plots along the vertical axis for each feature to show the distribution of values.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1)**: Replace the grid of squares with a proper nested treemap. The primary rectangles should represent 'Class', and within each, nest smaller rectangles for 'doors' and 'persons' to show the hierarchy. The 'pie chart segments' requirement is highly unconventional for a treemap; a standard nested treemap would be a more effective and compliant alternative.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 2)**: Add the requested error bars to the data points on the radar chart. To fix the cluttered labels, either reduce the number of radial grid lines or move the numeric labels to the outside of the chart's perimeter.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 0)**: Add the missing marginal histograms. A histogram for PC1 should be placed along the top x-axis, and a histogram for PC2 should be placed along the right y-axis.\n7.  **Subplot (2, 1)**: The 'Sankey diagram overlaid with bar chart' is ambiguous. A better approach would be to place horizontal bar charts next to the nodes on both the left and right sides of the Sankey, representing the total counts for each 'Safety' and 'Class' category, respectively.\n8.  **Subplot (2, 2)**: This plot needs to be completely redone as a standard network graph. Use a force-directed layout. Nodes should represent features/classes, with their size proportional to frequency. Edges should connect nodes, with thickness representing the co-occurrence strength. The current Venn diagram-style plot is not an effective or accurate representation of a network."
