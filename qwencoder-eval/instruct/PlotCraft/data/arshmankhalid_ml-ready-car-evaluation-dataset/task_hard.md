## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing car evaluation patterns across different categorical features. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Stacked bar chart with overlaid line plot showing buying price vs class distribution and acceptance rates, (2) Top-middle: Grouped violin plots with box plots overlay comparing safety levels across different maintenance costs, (3) Top-right: Heatmap with annotated correlation coefficients between encoded categorical variables, (4) Middle-left: Parallel coordinates plot with density curves showing feature interactions for each class, (5) Middle-middle: Treemap with pie chart segments showing hierarchical composition of doors and persons capacity by class, (6) Middle-right: Radar chart with error bars comparing mean feature scores across different luggage boot sizes, (7) Bottom-left: Clustered scatter plot with marginal histograms showing PCA-transformed feature space colored by class, (8) Bottom-middle: Sankey diagram overlaid with bar chart showing flow from safety levels to final evaluation classes, (9) Bottom-right: Network graph with node size proportional to class frequency and edge thickness representing feature co-occurrence patterns.
