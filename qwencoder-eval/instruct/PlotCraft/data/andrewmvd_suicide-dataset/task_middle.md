# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization with two subplots arranged vertically (2x1 layout). The top subplot should display a horizontal bar chart ranking the top 15 countries by their overall suicide rates (using "Both sexes" data), ordered from highest to lowest. The bottom subplot should create a grouped horizontal bar chart for these same top 15 countries, showing the comparison between male and female suicide rates side by side. Use different colors for male and female rates, add a legend, and ensure both charts have proper titles and axis labels. Include grid lines for better readability and highlight any significant gender disparities in the data.
