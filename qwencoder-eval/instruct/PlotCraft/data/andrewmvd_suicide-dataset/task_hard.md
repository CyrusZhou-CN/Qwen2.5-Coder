## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing suicide rate patterns and clustering across different demographic groups. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Country Analysis):
- Subplot 1: Scatter plot with marginal histograms showing suicide rates by country with overlaid box plots for regional groupings
- Subplot 2: Hierarchical clustering dendrogram combined with a heatmap showing country similarities based on suicide rates across sex categories
- Subplot 3: Radar chart overlaid with line plots comparing top 5 and bottom 5 countries across different sex categories

Middle row (Sex-based Groupings):
- Subplot 4: Violin plots combined with strip plots showing suicide rate distributions for each sex category, with overlaid statistical summary lines
- Subplot 5: Parallel coordinates plot combined with density curves showing how countries cluster based on male vs female suicide rates
- Subplot 6: Network graph overlaid on scatter plot showing countries as nodes connected by suicide rate similarity, colored by sex-based clustering

Bottom row (Cross-demographic Analysis):
- Subplot 7: Treemap combined with bubble chart showing hierarchical country groupings by suicide rate ranges with size indicating population representation
- Subplot 8: Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot combined with convex hull boundaries showing natural country clusters based on all sex-specific suicide rates
- Subplot 9: Correlation matrix heatmap overlaid with network connections showing relationships between different sex categories across countries, with cluster annotations
