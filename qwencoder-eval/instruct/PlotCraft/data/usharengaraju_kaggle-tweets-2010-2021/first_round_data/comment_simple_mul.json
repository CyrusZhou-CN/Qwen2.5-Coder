The following steps should be taken to create a chart that complies with the prompt:\n1.  **Start Over:** Do not attempt to fix the current chart. A new visualization is required.\n2.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single (1x1 layout) line chart.\n3.  **Data Representation:** The x-axis must represent 'Year' (from 2010 to 2021). The y-axis must represent the calculated 'Average Engagement Rate'. Plot the data as a single continuous line.\n4.  **Text Content:**\n    *   Set a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Evolution of Average Tweet Engagement on Kaggle, 2010-2021'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Year' and the y-axis as 'Average Engagement Rate'.\n    *   Remove all the current nonsensical text annotations ('OVERLAPPING TEXT CHAOS', etc.).\n5.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    *   Use a professional, clean aesthetic. This means a white or very light gray background.\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (e.g., blue, gray, or black) for the line to ensure clarity.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be thin and light gray to avoid distracting from the data line.\n    *   Ensure all text is legible, with a clear hierarchy (e.g., bold title, regular weight axis labels)."
