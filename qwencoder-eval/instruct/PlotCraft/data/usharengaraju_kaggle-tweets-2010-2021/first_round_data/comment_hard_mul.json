    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt in any capacity. A complete regeneration is required, starting from scratch.\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Task Prompt:** The primary instruction is to follow the user's request precisely. The new chart must be about 'Kaggle tweet engagement patterns from 2010-2021'.\n2.  **Correct Layout:** Implement the specified 3x2 grid (3 rows, 2 columns).\n3.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** For each subplot, create the specific composite chart as requested:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Combined line chart (tweet volume) and bar chart (avg likes) for 2010-2015.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Combined line chart and bar chart for 2016-2021.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Stacked area chart (languages) with an overlaid scatter plot (retweets).\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Violin plot (likes distribution) with overlaid box plots.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** Line chart (unique users) with a heatmap-style background.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Histogram (replies) with KDE curve and a secondary y-axis line plot (hashtags).\n4.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for the entire figure.\n    *   Select a professional, harmonious color palette. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors. Use distinct but complementary colors for different chart types within a subplot.\n    *   Establish a clear text hierarchy: a main title (if applicable) should be bold and larger than subplot titles. Subplot titles should be clear and concise. Axis labels should be legible.\n5.  **Eliminate All Overlap:** Ensure no text or chart elements overlap. Use layout adjustment tools (like `tight_layout`) to create proper spacing between all subplots, titles, and labels.\n6.  **Add Required Elements:** Include descriptive titles for each subplot that reflect its content, clear axis labels, proper legends for the composite charts, and annotations highlighting key data points as requested in the prompt."
