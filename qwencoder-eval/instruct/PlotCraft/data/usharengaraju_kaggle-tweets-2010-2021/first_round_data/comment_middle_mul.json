    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to align with the prompt. \n1. **Fundamental Redesign:** Discard the current visualization entirely. The new chart must be based on the specified topic: 'Kaggle tweet engagement patterns from 2010-2021'.\n2. **Layout:** Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid. Ensure proper spacing between subplots for clarity using a function like `tight_layout()`.\n3. **Subplot Content:** Each subplot must be created as specified:\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** A combination line chart (yearly tweet volume) and bar chart (average engagement).\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** A stacked area chart showing the cumulative distribution of the top 5 tweet languages over time.\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** A dual-axis plot with a line chart (monthly tweet frequency) on the primary axis and a scatter plot (seasonal engagement spikes) on the secondary axis.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** A time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal, and residual components.\n4. **Formatting and Professionalism:** Adopt a publication-ready standard. Use a white background, remove the heavy white borders around plots, and use subtle, light-gray gridlines. The main title should be bold and larger than axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n5. **Text and Labels:** All titles and axis labels must be corrected to be descriptive and relevant to the Kaggle tweet data (e.g., 'Year', 'Tweet Count', 'Average Engagement', 'Language Distribution').\n6. **Color Scheme:** Replace the current jarring colors with a professional, harmonious color palette (e.g., a colorblind-friendly palette from Seaborn or Matplotlib's 'viridis' colormap). Use colors consistently across subplots where applicable.\n7. **Clarity:** Remove all overlapping text. Ensure all labels, percentages, and annotations are placed in clear space and do not obscure the data."
