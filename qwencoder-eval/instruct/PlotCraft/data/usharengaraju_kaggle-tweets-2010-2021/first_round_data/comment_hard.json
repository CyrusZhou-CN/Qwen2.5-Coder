    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and cannot be improved; it must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken to create a compliant and high-quality visualization:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Correction:** The entire chart must be rebuilt to address the specified topic of Kaggle tweet engagement from 2010-2021. All current plots and data are irrelevant and must be discarded.\n\n2.  **Layout:** Create a 3x3 subplot grid as requested. Ensure proper spacing between subplots to avoid overlap, for instance by using a function like `tight_layout()` after plotting.\n\n3.  **Content and Chart Types (by row):**\n    *   **Top Row (sublots (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) for 2010-2013):** Implement dual-axis plots. Use bars for monthly tweet volume on the primary y-axis and a line with error bars for average engagement rate on the secondary y-axis.\n    *   **Middle Row (subplots (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) for 2014-2017):** Create stacked area charts for language distribution. Overlay a line plot on a secondary axis for the 30-day rolling average of retweets.\n    *   **Bottom Row (subplots (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) for 2018-2021):** Generate combination plots with violin plots showing the distribution of likes, overlaid with narrower box plots to show quartiles. Add a trend line for the median.\n\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background. If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin, dashed).\n    *   **Color Palette:** Select a professional and harmonious color palette. Use consistent colors for the same metrics across all relevant subplots (e.g., all tweet volume bars should be the same color). Use a color-blind friendly palette for categorical data like languages.\n    *   **Text and Titles:** Each subplot must have a clear, descriptive title indicating the year it represents (e.g., 'Tweet Engagement, 2010'). All axes must be accurately labeled with appropriate units. Use a clear typographic hierarchy, with the main title (if any) being largest, followed by subplot titles, then axis labels.\n    *   **Legends:** Add clear legends where necessary, especially for the stacked area charts, and place them in a location that does not obscure data.\n    *   **Axis Scaling:** Ensure that the y-axes for similar metrics (e.g., 'Tweet Volume') are consistent across the relevant subplots to allow for accurate visual comparison between years."
