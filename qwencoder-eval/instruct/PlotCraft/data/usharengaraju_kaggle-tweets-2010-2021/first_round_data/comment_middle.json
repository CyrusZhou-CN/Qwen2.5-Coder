    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete deviation from the prompt and requires a full recreation from scratch. No part of the current chart is salvageable.\n\n**1. Adhere to the Prompt:**\n   - The primary issue is the complete failure to follow the instructions. The new chart must be based on the specified topic: 'Kaggle's social media engagement evolution from 2010-2021'.\n\n**2. Layout and Structure:**\n   - Create a proper 2x2 subplot grid. Use functions like `plt.subplots(2, 2)` to establish the correct layout.\n   - Ensure proper spacing between subplots to avoid overlap, for instance by using `plt.tight_layout()`.\n\n**3. Implement Correct Chart Types and Data:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a combined line chart (tweet volume) and bar chart (average engagement) per year.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a stacked area chart (language proportions) with a secondary y-axis for a line chart (tweet diversity).\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** Perform and plot a time series seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual) of monthly tweet data.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** Create a dual-axis plot with a line chart (hashtag usage) and a scatter plot (tweet length vs. engagement).\n\n**4. Professional Formatting:**\n   - **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data.\n   - **Color Palette:** Select a professional and harmonious color palette. Avoid the use of jarring, high-saturation primary and neon colors.\n   - **Text and Labels:** Ensure all text is horizontal, legible, and correctly labeled according to the data. Titles should be clear and concise. Establish a visual hierarchy with a bold main title for the entire figure and distinct, non-bold titles for each subplot.\n   - **Remove Clutter:** Do not add any extraneous, rotated, or overlapping text that is not directly relevant to the data being presented."
