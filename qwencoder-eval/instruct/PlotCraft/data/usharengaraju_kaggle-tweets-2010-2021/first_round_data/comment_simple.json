The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Discard the 2x2 grid. Create a single (1x1) plot using a line chart to show the trend over time.\n2.  **Data Representation:** The x-axis must represent the years from 2010 to 2021. The y-axis must represent the calculated 'Average Engagement Rate'.\n3.  **Text Content:**\n    *   Provide a clear, descriptive main title, such as 'Average Tweet Engagement Rate on Kaggle, 2010-2021'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Year' and the y-axis as 'Average Engagement Rate'.\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   Use a professional, publication-ready theme with a white background.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines) to avoid distracting from the data line.\n    *   Use a single, clean color (e.g., a standard blue or dark gray) for the line plot.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n    *   Remove the heavy white borders around the plot area for a cleaner look.\n5.  **Annotations:** To fulfill the requirement to 'highlight any notable trends', add annotations to the chart. For example, use a text box with an arrow to point to a year with a significant spike or dip in engagement, briefly explaining the potential cause if known."
