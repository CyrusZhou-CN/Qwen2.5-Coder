## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Kaggle tweet engagement patterns from 2010-2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2010-2015 vs 2016-2021 comparison):
- Subplot 1: Combined line chart showing tweet volume trends over time with overlaid bar chart showing average likes per tweet for years 2010-2015
- Subplot 2: Combined line chart showing tweet volume trends over time with overlaid bar chart showing average likes per tweet for years 2016-2021

Middle row (Language and engagement analysis):
- Subplot 3: Stacked area chart showing the proportion of different languages (English, Japanese, others) over time, with overlaid scatter plot showing average retweet counts by language
- Subplot 4: Combined violin plot showing the distribution of likes_count by year with overlaid box plots highlighting median engagement levels

Bottom row (User activity and content analysis):
- Subplot 5: Line chart showing unique user count trends over time with overlaid heatmap-style background showing tweet density patterns throughout different time periods
- Subplot 6: Combined histogram showing distribution of replies_count with overlaid KDE curve, and a secondary y-axis line plot showing the evolution of average hashtag usage per tweet over the years

Each composite subplot should include proper legends, different colors for each chart type, and annotations highlighting key trends or inflection points in Kaggle's social media presence evolution.
