## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Kaggle tweet engagement patterns from 2010-2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2010-2013): For each year, create a dual-axis plot showing monthly tweet volume as bars overlaid with a line chart tracking average engagement rate (likes + retweets per tweet). Add error bars to the line chart showing standard deviation of engagement.

Middle row (2014-2017): For each year, create a stacked area chart showing the cumulative distribution of tweets by language over time, with a secondary line plot overlay showing the rolling 30-day average of retweet counts.

Bottom row (2018-2021): For each year, create a combination of violin plots showing the distribution of likes per tweet by month, overlaid with box plots, and include a trend line showing the median likes progression throughout each year.

Each subplot should include proper titles indicating the year, color-coded legends, and consistent scaling across similar metrics to enable cross-year comparison of Kaggle's growing social media presence and community engagement evolution.
