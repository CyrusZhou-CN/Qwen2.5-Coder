## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of tweet engagement over time from 2010 to 2021. Calculate the average engagement rate for each year by combining likes_count, retweets_count, and replies_count into a single engagement metric, then plot how this average engagement changes across the years. Include proper axis labels, a title, and highlight any notable trends or patterns in Kaggle-related tweet engagement over this 11-year period.
