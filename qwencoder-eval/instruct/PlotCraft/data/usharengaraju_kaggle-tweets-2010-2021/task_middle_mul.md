## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis of Kaggle tweet engagement patterns from 2010-2021. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization elements: (1) Top-left: A line chart showing yearly tweet volume trends overlaid with a bar chart displaying average engagement metrics (likes + retweets) per year, (2) Top-right: An area chart depicting the cumulative distribution of tweet languages over time with stacked areas for the top 5 languages, (3) Bottom-left: A dual-axis plot combining a line chart of monthly tweet frequency patterns overlaid with a scatter plot showing seasonal engagement spikes, and (4) Bottom-right: A time series decomposition showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of daily tweet activity across the entire dataset period. Each subplot should include appropriate legends, annotations for significant events or patterns, and use consistent color schemes to highlight the evolution of Kaggle's social media presence and community engagement over the decade.
