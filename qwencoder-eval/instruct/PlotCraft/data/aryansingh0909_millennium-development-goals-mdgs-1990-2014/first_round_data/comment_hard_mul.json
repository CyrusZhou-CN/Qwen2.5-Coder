    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Layout Correction**: The most critical change is to correct the layout to the specified 3x2 grid. The current 2x3 grid does not match the prompt.\n2. **Title Placement**: Reposition the main title 'Millennium Development Goals Progress Analysis (1990-2014)' to be entirely above the grid of subplots to eliminate the severe overlap with the individual subplot titles. Use a function like `fig.suptitle()` and adjust the top margin of the figure.\n3. **Complete Missing Visualizations**: \n   - In subplot (0,2), add the required scatter plot to show the correlation between Maternal Mortality and GDP per capita. This is a mandatory task requirement that was missed.\n   - In subplot (0,0), the bar charts for 2014 values are rendered as extremely thin vertical lines. Increase the width of these bars so they are clearly identifiable as bar charts.\n4. **Add Required Annotations**: The prompt required annotations on each subplot. Add annotations to subplots (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1) to highlight key data points, trends, or significant changes as instructed.\n5. **Text and Label Adjustments**:\n   - In subplot (0,0), adjust the layout padding to ensure the y-axis label ('Births per 1,000 women (15-19)') is not cut off at the bottom.\n   - In subplot (1,1), shorten or reformat the y-axis label 'Forest Area (%) / CO2 Emissions (scaled)' for better readability. Consider using a two-line label.\n6. **Legend Optimization**: In subplot (0,1), the two separate legends for 'Enrollment' and 'Life Exp' create clutter. Combine them into a single, well-placed legend, possibly outside the plot area, to improve clarity."
