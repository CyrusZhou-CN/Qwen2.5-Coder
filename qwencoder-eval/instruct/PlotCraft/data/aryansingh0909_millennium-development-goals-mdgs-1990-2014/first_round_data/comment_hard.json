    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements. \n\n1.  **Complete All Subplots:** The primary issue is the missing and incomplete data visualizations. All 9 subplots must be generated according to the detailed instructions. This includes plotting the data for the empty charts ((0,0), (1,0), (1,1)) and adding the missing elements (comparative bars, violin plots, scatter plots) to the partially completed ones.\n\n2.  **Fix Layout and Spacing:** Use a layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9, hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)`) to create adequate spacing. The main title 'Millennium Development Goals...' should be positioned higher to avoid overlapping with the subplot titles. Increase the horizontal and vertical space between subplots to prevent labels from colliding.\n\n3.  **Ensure Text Readability:**\n    *   For subplot (2,0), rotate the x-axis tick labels (e.g., `rotation=45`, `ha='right'`) to prevent them from overlapping.\n    *   Correct the generic axes on the currently empty plots to reflect the actual data ranges and units (e.g., 'Enrollment Rate (%)', 'GDP per Capita (USD)').\n\n4.  **Standardize Color Schemes:** Create a single, consistent color dictionary for regions and another for income groups. Apply these dictionaries to all relevant subplots to ensure, for example, that 'North America' is the same color in every plot it appears in. This is critical for fulfilling the 'comprehensive analysis' goal.\n\n5.  **Adopt Professional Formatting Standards:**\n    *   Set the figure and all axes backgrounds to white (`facecolor='white'`).\n    *   Make the gridlines subtle by setting them to a light gray color, a dashed line style, and a thin line width (e.g., `color='lightgray'`, `linestyle='--'`, `linewidth=0.5`).\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy: make the main title the largest and boldest, followed by subplot titles (also bold but smaller), and then axis labels.\n\n6.  **Refine Individual Plots:**\n    *   In subplot (0,1), reposition the legend or adjust the plot margins to prevent the right y-axis label from overlapping it.\n    *   In subplot (0,2), ensure the violin plot clearly compares the distributions for 1990 and 2014 as requested, perhaps by plotting two side-by-side violin plots at those specific x-coordinates."
