    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Complete the Missing Visualizations**: The highest priority is to correctly implement the charts in subplots (0, 1) and (1, 1). Subplot (0, 1) needs to be a stacked area chart showing enrollment rates by income group, with the global average line on a secondary y-axis. Subplot (1, 1) must be a combined bar chart (for GDP growth) and line chart (for poverty reduction), with colors used to represent different regional classifications as requested.\n2. **Correct Text and Labels**: In subplot (1, 1), ensure the axis labels and legend accurately describe the data being plotted. The left y-axis should correspond to the bars (GDP Growth) and the right y-axis to the line (Poverty Rate). The legend must be updated to show regional classifications.\n3. **Reduce Clutter**: In subplot (0, 0), reduce the visual clutter by either decreasing the marker size of the scatter points, lowering their opacity (`alpha`), or plotting a random subsample of the points. This will make the trend lines and confidence bands more visible.\n4. **Improve Layout Spacing**: Reduce the excessive horizontal and vertical spacing between the subplots (`wspace` and `hspace`) to create a more cohesive and compact figure. This will improve the overall visual flow and balance.\n5. **Enhance Professional Formatting**: For a more polished, publication-ready appearance: (a) Make the plot spines (the black border lines) thinner and a lighter gray. (b) Increase the font weight of the main titles to create a clearer visual hierarchy. (c) Ensure consistent line widths and marker styles across all plots where applicable."
