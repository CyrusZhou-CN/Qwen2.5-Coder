    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is a critical data failure that must be resolved before any visual improvements can be made. \n1. **Data Loading and Processing:** The most urgent step is to debug the data pipeline. Ensure that the life expectancy data is correctly filtered from 'MDG_Data.csv', successfully merged with regional data from 'MDG_Country.csv', and that the resulting dataset is not empty. The 'nan' values in the text box confirm this failure.\n2. **Plot Histogram Data:** Once the data is correctly loaded, plot it as a histogram. The bars should represent the frequency of life expectancy values within specific bins.\n3. **Implement Color Coding and Legend:** Apply colors to the histogram bars based on the 'World Region' data as requested. Add a legend to the chart that clearly maps each color to its corresponding region. The current empty legend box in the top-right corner should be populated or removed.\n4. **Correct Axis Scales:** The y-axis ('Frequency') must be corrected to start at 0 and not display negative values. The x-axis ('Life Expectancy (Years)') range of 0.0 to 1.0 seems incorrect for life expectancy in years; it should be adjusted to reflect the actual range of the data (e.g., 30 to 90).\n5. **Update Text Box:** After the data is processed correctly, recalculate and update the statistics in the text box to show the actual Total Observations, Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation."
