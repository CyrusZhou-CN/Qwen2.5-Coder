## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of life expectancy values across all countries and years in the dataset. Use data from the main MDG_Data.csv file, filtering for the life expectancy indicator, and combine it with country information from MDG_Country.csv to add regional context through color coding. The histogram should display the frequency of different life expectancy ranges and use different colors to represent different world regions.
