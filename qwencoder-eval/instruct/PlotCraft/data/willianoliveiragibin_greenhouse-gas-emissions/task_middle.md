## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of per capita CO₂ emissions over time. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays line charts for the top 5 highest emitting entities in the most recent year, and the bottom plot shows a stacked area chart representing the cumulative emissions contribution of different continental regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, etc.) over the time period. Include proper legends, titles, and ensure the y-axes are appropriately scaled to highlight the temporal trends and regional differences in emissions patterns.
