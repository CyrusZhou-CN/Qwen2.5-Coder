# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of per capita CO₂ emissions across different geographical entities. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): For the top 3 highest emitting entities in the most recent year, create line charts with confidence bands showing emission trends over time, overlaid with scatter plots highlighting significant year-over-year changes (>20% increase or decrease).

Middle row (3 subplots): For three representative continental/regional entities (Africa, Asia, Europe), create area charts showing cumulative emissions over time combined with bar charts showing the rate of change between consecutive time periods.

Bottom row (3 subplots): Create slope charts comparing emission levels between the earliest and latest years for the top 10 entities, overlaid with dot plots showing intermediate year values, and add error bars representing the volatility (standard deviation) of emissions across the time series for each entity.
