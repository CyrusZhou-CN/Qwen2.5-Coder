## Instruction
Create a line chart showing how annual CO₂ emissions per capita have changed over time for the top 5 entities with the highest emissions in the most recent year available in the dataset. Convert the emissions data to numeric format, filter out any zero or missing values, and use different colors and line styles to distinguish between entities. Include a legend, proper axis labels, and a title that clearly indicates the time period covered.
