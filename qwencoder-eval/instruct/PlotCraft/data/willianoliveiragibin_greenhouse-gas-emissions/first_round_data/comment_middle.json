    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt in any way. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. A compliant chart would require the following:\n1.  **Layout:** Implement the correct 2x1 layout (two rows, one column).\n2.  **Chart Types:** The top subplot (0, 0) must be a line chart, and the bottom subplot (1, 0) must be a stacked area chart.\n3.  **Data and Content:** The chart must visualize data related to per capita CO₂ emissions over time as specified in the prompt.\n4.  **Titles and Labels:** Add a main title like 'Evolution of Per Capita CO₂ Emissions'. The top subplot (0, 0) should be titled 'Top 5 Highest Emitting Entities' and the bottom subplot (1, 0) 'Cumulative Emissions by Continent'. All axes must be labeled correctly (e.g., 'Year' for the x-axis and 'Per Capita CO₂ Emissions' for the y-axis).\n5.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Use a professional white background instead of black.\n    *   Replace the neon color palette with a more subtle, professional color scheme.\n    *   Remove the distracting, thick yellow borders around the plots.\n    *   Ensure gridlines are light gray and unobtrusive.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy for text elements (e.g., bold title, regular axis labels).\n    *   Ensure no text or elements overlap with the data."
