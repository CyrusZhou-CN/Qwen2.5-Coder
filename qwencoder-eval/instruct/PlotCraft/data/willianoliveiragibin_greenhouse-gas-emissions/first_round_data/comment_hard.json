    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt in any meaningful way. It cannot be improved; it must be completely redone from scratch.\n\nTo meet the prompt's requirements, the following steps are necessary:\n1.  **Adhere to the Task:** The primary focus must be on fulfilling the detailed instructions in the prompt. This includes using the correct data (CO₂ emissions), layout (3x3 grid), and specific composite chart types for each subplot.\n2.  **Layout and Structure:** Create a 3x3 grid of subplots. Ensure adequate spacing between plots to prevent a cramped look.\n3.  **Chart Implementation (by row):\n    *   **Top Row (0,0), (0,1), (0,2):** Generate line charts with confidence bands and overlay scatter plots as specified.\n    *   **Middle Row (1,0), (1,1), (1,2):** Generate area charts combined with bar charts as specified.\n    *   **Bottom Row (2,0), (2,1), (2,2):** Generate slope charts with overlaid dot plots and error bars as specified.\n4.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background. If gridlines are necessary, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines).\n    *   **Color Palette:** Select a professional, harmonious color palette. Use distinct but not jarring colors to differentiate data series. Avoid the use of neon colors on a black background.\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. Use a single, bold, horizontal main title for the entire figure. Subplot titles should be smaller and consistent. All axis labels, tick labels, and legends should be horizontal, legible, and use a standard color like black or dark gray.\n    *   **Remove Clutter:** Do not add any large, rotated, or overlapping text watermarks. All text should serve a clear purpose and be positioned to not interfere with data elements."
