Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing Netflix content composition across different dimensions. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A stacked bar chart showing the distribution of maturity ratings within each main genre, (2) Top-right: A pie chart displaying the overall composition of content by main genre, (3) Bottom-left: A horizontal bar chart ranking genres by their average release year to show content recency, and (4) Bottom-right: A treemap visualization showing the hierarchical composition of content by main genre and maturity rating combinations. Use consistent color schemes across all subplots and ensure proper titles and labels for each visualization.
