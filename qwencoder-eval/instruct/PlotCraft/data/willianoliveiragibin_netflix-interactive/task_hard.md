## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing Netflix content clustering and recommendation patterns. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Scatter plot with density contours showing the relationship between Release Year and Maturity Rating, colored by Main Genre with bubble sizes representing recommendation network density, (2) Stacked bar chart overlaid with line plot showing genre distribution across decades with trend lines for each major genre, (3) Hierarchical cluster heatmap with dendrogram showing content similarity based on genre combinations and maturity ratings.

Middle row: (4) Network graph with node clustering showing recommendation connections between titles, where node sizes represent centrality and colors represent genre communities, overlaid with convex hulls around genre clusters, (5) Parallel coordinates plot combined with violin plots showing the multi-dimensional relationships between Release Year, Main Genre, Maturity Rating, and recommendation strength, (6) Treemap with nested rectangles showing genre hierarchy overlaid with scatter points indicating release year distribution within each genre.

Bottom row: (7) Radar chart with multiple overlays comparing genre profiles across different decades, combined with error bars showing variance, (8) Sankey diagram showing content flow from Main Genre to Sub Genres to Maturity Ratings, overlaid with histogram distributions at each stage, (9) 3D scatter plot projected onto 2D with contour lines showing content clusters in the space of Release Year, Genre diversity index, and Recommendation network connectivity.
