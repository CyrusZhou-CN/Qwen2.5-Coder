Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality chart:\n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Discard both the pie chart and the scatter plot. Create a single (1x1 layout) histogram.\n2. **Axes and Data:** The x-axis should represent the 'Release Year' of Netflix content. The y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Number of Titles'. Plot the distribution of release years on these axes.\n3. **Binning:** Apply appropriate binning to the 'Release Year' data. For example, use bins of a single year to show year-over-year changes in content volume.\n4. **Titles and Labels:**\n   - Set a clear, descriptive main title, such as 'Distribution of Netflix Content by Release Year'.\n   - Label the x-axis as 'Release Year'.\n   - Label the y-axis as 'Number of Titles'.\n5. **Formatting and Styling:**\n   - Use a clean, white background for the entire chart.\n   - Use a single, professional color (e.g., a neutral blue or gray) for the histogram bars.\n   - If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin) and orient them horizontally (along the y-axis) to help read the frequency values.\n   - Ensure all text is legible, correctly spelled, and uses a standard, professional font. The title should be bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n6. **Remove Extraneous Elements:** Do not include any irrelevant titles, annotations, or multiple subplots. The focus should be solely on presenting the distribution data clearly and effectively."
