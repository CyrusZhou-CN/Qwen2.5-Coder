    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and cannot be salvaged. It must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's prompt.\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Prompt:** The most critical improvement is to follow the task instructions. The theme is 'Netflix content composition', not 'Quantum Flux Analysis'.\n2.  **Layout Refinement:** Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid. Use `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)` and ensure adequate spacing between plots using `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`.\n3.  **Correct Chart Types and Data:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the scatter plot with a stacked bar chart showing maturity ratings per genre.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the line chart with a pie chart showing the overall distribution of main genres.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the pie chart with a horizontal bar chart ranking genres by average release year. Ensure the bars are sorted.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the vertical bar chart with a treemap showing the genre and maturity rating hierarchy.\n4.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Remove the 'OVERLAPPING TEXT' watermarks from all subplots.\n    *   Provide a relevant main title, such as 'Netflix Content Composition Analysis'.\n    *   Each subplot must have a clear, descriptive title (e.g., 'Distribution of Maturity Ratings by Genre', 'Overall Genre Composition').\n    *   All axes must be correctly labeled (e.g., 'Genre', 'Count', 'Average Release Year').\n    *   Ensure all tick labels are legible, correctly formatted, and not overlapping.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Switch to a professional, publication-ready style with a white background.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines) and not distracting.\n    *   Establish a clear typographic hierarchy: the main title should be bold and larger than subplot titles, which should be larger than axis labels.\n6.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   Develop a single, harmonious color palette to represent the main genres. This same palette should be used consistently across all four subplots to create a cohesive and visually linked dashboard."
