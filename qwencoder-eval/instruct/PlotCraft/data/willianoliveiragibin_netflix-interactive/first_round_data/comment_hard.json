    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete deviation from the prompt and an example of poor design. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n1. **Adhere to the Prompt:** The primary step is to follow the user's instructions. Create a 3x3 subplot grid. For each of the 9 positions, generate the specific, complex chart type requested (e.g., scatter with density contours for subplot (0, 0), network graph for subplot (1, 0), etc.) using data relevant to Netflix content.\n2. **Professional Formatting:** Use a white background for a clean, professional look. If gridlines are necessary, make them thin and light gray so they don't distract from the data.\n3. **Color Palette:** Replace the current clashing, high-saturation colors with a professional, harmonious color palette. Use color intentionally to distinguish categories, not for shock value.\n4. **Text and Labels:** Remove all nonsensical, overlapping, and distracting text overlays ('MORE CONFUSION', 'TEXT CHAOS', etc.). Use clear, legible fonts. All titles and axis labels must be accurate, descriptive, and relevant to the Netflix data being analyzed. The main title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n5. **Clarity and Layout:** Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Arrange the 3x3 grid with adequate spacing between subplots to ensure each visualization is distinct and readable. The final product should be clean, organized, and informative, not chaotic and confusing."
