Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of tech startup hiring patterns across different company sizes. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of job categories (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Product, etc.) across different employee size ranges, and the bottom plot shows a pie chart highlighting the overall proportion of total job openings by employee size category. Extract job category counts from the 'jobs' column and use the 'employees' column for company size segmentation.
