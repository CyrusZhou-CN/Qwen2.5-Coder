It must be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Layout and Chart Type Correction**: The entire visualization needs to be rebuilt using the specified 2x1 layout. The top subplot (0, 0) must be a stacked bar chart, and the bottom subplot (1, 0) must be a pie chart.\n2. **Content Correction for Subplot (0, 0)**: This plot should be a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of job categories across different company sizes. The x-axis should represent company size ranges (e.g., '1-10', '11-50'), and the y-axis should represent the number of jobs. Each bar should be segmented by job category (e.g., Engineering, Sales), and a legend should be provided to identify the categories.\n3. **Content Correction for Subplot (1, 0)**: This plot should be a pie chart illustrating the total proportion of job openings for each company size category. Each slice should be clearly labeled with the corresponding company size and its percentage of the total.\n4. **Text and Labels**: All titles and axis labels must be corrected to be relevant to the task. For example, the title for the top plot could be 'Hiring Distribution by Job Category and Company Size', and for the bottom plot, 'Proportion of Job Openings by Company Size'.\n5. **Professional Formatting**: Adopt a professional aesthetic. Use a white background with subtle, light gray gridlines. Choose a harmonious and distinct color palette for the stacked bars and pie slices. Ensure a clear visual hierarchy by making the main titles bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
