It must be discarded and created from scratch.\n\n1.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the current pie chart and scatter plot with a single horizontal bar chart in a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data and Ranking:** The chart must visualize the top 10 tech startups ranked by the total number of job openings. The y-axis should list the company names, and the x-axis should represent the 'Total Job Openings'. The bars should be ordered descendingly, with the company having the most job openings at the top.\n3.  **Annotations:** Add data labels to the end of each bar to display the exact total job count for each company. This fulfills a specific requirement of the prompt.\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a white background with light gray, subtle horizontal gridlines to guide the eye. Remove the heavy, colored border.\n    *   **Colors:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a medium blue or gray) for all bars to maintain a professional look. Avoid rainbow or overly saturated color schemes.\n    *   **Typography:** Set a clear title, such as 'Top 10 Tech Startups by Total Job Openings', in a larger, bold font. Use a standard, legible font for all axis labels, tick labels, and data annotations. Ensure the y-axis labels (company names) are fully readable and not truncated.\n    *   **Axes:** Label the x-axis 'Total Job Openings' and the y-axis 'Company'."
