# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 tech startups with the highest total number of job openings. Extract the total job count for each company by parsing the 'jobs' column (which contains job categories and their counts in parentheses format), sum up all job counts per company, and display the companies ranked from highest to lowest total job openings. Include the exact job count numbers on the bars and ensure company names are clearly readable on the y-axis.
