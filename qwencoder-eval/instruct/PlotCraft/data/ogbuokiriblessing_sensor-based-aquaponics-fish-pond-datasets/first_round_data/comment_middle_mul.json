    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Chart Type (Critical):** Replace the single scatter plot in subplot (0, 1) with the required scatter plot matrix (pair plot). This matrix should visualize the relationships between the three most correlated variables from the heatmap: 'Nitrate', 'Turbidity', and 'Dissolved_Oxygen'.\n2. **Enhance Color Palette:** Replace the current color scheme for the ponds with a more distinct, colorblind-friendly palette. The similarity between 'Pond_2' (light green) and 'Pond_3' (yellow) is particularly problematic. A palette with higher contrast (e.g., blue, orange, green) would significantly improve readability across subplots (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).\n3. **Improve Title Alignment:** Center the main figure title, 'Comprehensive Aquaponics Correlation Analysis', above the entire 2x2 grid for better visual balance and a more professional layout.\n4. **Refine Text Formatting:** In the heatmap at subplot (0, 0), remove the trailing hyphens from the y-axis tick labels (e.g., change 'Temperature -' to 'Temperature') for a cleaner appearance.\n5. **Adjust Transparency:** In the regression plot at subplot (1, 1), consider making the confidence interval fills slightly more transparent (lower alpha value). This would make the underlying data points and the regression lines themselves more prominent."
