    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, several specific changes are needed:\n1.  **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n    -   **Subplot (0,1):** Overlay box plots on the parallel coordinates plot for each parameter to show data distribution.\n    -   **Subplot (0,2):** Add shaded confidence intervals or error bars around each line on the radar chart.\n    -   **Subplot (1,1):** Add the missing 'medium (60-70)' population category. Overlay strip plots on the violin plots to show individual data points.\n    -   **Subplot (1,2):** Add the hierarchical clustering dendrogram to the top or left of the heatmap.\n    -   **Subplot (2,0):** Replace the few illustrative lines with a proper network graph overlay, where nodes are parameters and edges are weighted by correlation.\n    -   **Subplot (2,2):** Add 2D density contour lines to the scatter plot to show point density.\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    -   Increase the overall figure height or adjust `hspace` between subplots to add more vertical whitespace between rows, preventing titles from appearing cramped.\n    -   For subplots (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0), adjust the bottom margin (`bottom` in `subplots_adjust`) or use text wrapping to ensure x-axis labels are fully visible and do not overlap.\n3.  **Color and Clarity:**\n    -   Choose a more distinct color palette for the clusters. For example, replace the light green for 'Cluster 2' with a more distinct color like purple or yellow to improve differentiation from the teal of 'Cluster 1'.\n    -   In subplot (0,0), increase the line width and/or opacity of the KDE contours so they are clearly visible.\n    -   In subplot (2,1), reduce the opacity of the filled areas and consider plotting a smoothed moving average for the lines to reduce clutter.\n4.  **Text and Formatting:**\n    -   In subplot (1,1), change the y-axis label from 'Fish Characteristics' to a more specific label, or create two separate violin plots for 'Length' and 'Weight'.\n    -   In subplot (1,0), set the y-axis limit to start at 0 (`ylim(0, ...)`) to prevent the regression line from extending into a physically impossible negative weight range."
