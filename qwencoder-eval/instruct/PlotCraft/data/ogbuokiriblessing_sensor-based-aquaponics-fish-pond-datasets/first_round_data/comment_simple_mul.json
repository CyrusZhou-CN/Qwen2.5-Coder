    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the severe overlap of the histograms, which makes comparison difficult. Here are specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Resolve Overlap**: Instead of overlaying filled histograms, use one of the following clearer methods:\n    *   **Stepped Histograms**: Change the histogram type to 'step' (`histtype='step'`) and increase the line width. This will plot only the outlines of the distributions, allowing all three to be seen clearly without overlap.\n    *   **Faceted Plots (Subplots)**: Create a 3x1 grid of subplots, where each subplot shows the histogram for a single pond. This completely eliminates overlap and is the clearest method for comparing distributions. Ensure the x and y axes are shared across subplots for accurate comparison.\n    *   **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plot**: A KDE plot would show smoothed versions of the distributions, which are often easier to interpret than histograms when overlaid, especially with transparency.\n\n2.  **Adjust Axis Limits**: Narrow the x-axis range to focus on the relevant data. For pH, a range from 0 to 14 would be standard. Based on the data shown, a range from approximately 2 to 10 would be even better, as it would eliminate the empty white space and magnify the area of interest.\n\n3.  **Enhance Formatting for Professionalism**:\n    *   **Title**: Make the main title bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Gridlines**: Add subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines (`grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)`) to make it easier to estimate the frequency values of the bars.\n\n4.  **Improve Color Scheme**: Select a more professional color palette. For example, use a qualitative palette from a library like Seaborn or ColorBrewer that provides distinct but harmonious colors. Avoid the default primary red, green, and blue."
