    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical issue is the failure to plot the data. The underlying code must be debugged to ensure that the pH data from the various CSV files is correctly loaded, combined, and processed. Specifically:\n1.  **Data Visualization**: The histogram with 20 bins must be generated and displayed. The bars should be filled with a color that aligns with the 'water quality' theme, such as a shade of blue or the light teal used for the vertical lines.\n2.  **Summary Statistics**: The calculation for the summary statistics needs to be fixed. The text box in the top-left corner should be populated with the correct numerical values for the mean, median, standard deviation, and total number of measurements, replacing the current 'nan' and '0' placeholders.\n3.  **Y-Axis Range**: The y-axis ('Frequency') currently has a negative range, which is inappropriate for a frequency count. Once the data is plotted correctly, the y-axis lower limit should be set to 0.\n4.  **Title Formatting**: While the title is bolded, it uses markdown-style asterisks (`**...**`). For better practice, use the plotting library's native font weight parameter (e.g., `fontweight='bold'`) to format the title."
