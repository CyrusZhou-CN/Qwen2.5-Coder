    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and critical issue is the complete absence of data visualization. The chart must be regenerated to actually plot the data according to the prompt.\n1.  **Plot Data:** All four subplots need to be populated with the specified charts. The current text annotations ('Data not available') should be replaced with the actual visualizations.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Implement the scatter plot of 'Dissolved Oxygen' vs. 'Fish Weight'. Points must be colored by 'Pond ID' and sized by 'Population Density'.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Generate the correlation heatmap for all specified water quality parameters. Include a color bar legend to show correlation values.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Create the scatter plot of 'pH' vs. 'Fish Length', including the requested regression line. Use different marker styles for different pond populations.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1):** Create the bubble plot with 'Temperature' on the x-axis, 'Ammonia' on the y-axis, and bubble size corresponding to 'Fish Weight'. Color the bubbles by 'Pond ID'. Update the title to be more descriptive, such as 'Temperature vs. Ammonia & Fish Weight'.\n6.  **Legends and Labels:** Add comprehensive legends to all plots to explain the color, size, and marker encodings. Ensure all axes are clearly labeled with the variable name and units (e.g., 'Temperature (°C)', 'Fish Weight (g)').\n7.  **Color Consistency:** Ensure the color scheme used to represent 'Pond ID' is consistent across subplot (0, 0) and subplot (1, 1)."
