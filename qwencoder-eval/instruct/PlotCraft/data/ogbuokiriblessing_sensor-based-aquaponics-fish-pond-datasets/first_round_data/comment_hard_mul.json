    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart fundamentally misunderstands the user's request and needs to be completely redone. The primary suggestion is to create a new chart that adheres to the prompt's instructions for a 3x2 time series dashboard.\n\nIf attempting to fix the existing (incorrect) chart:\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Immediately change the layout from 2x3 to the requested 3x2 grid.\n2.  **Title Placement:** Resolve the title overlap by adding vertical padding between the main title and the first row of subplots. For example, using `fig.suptitle('Title', y=1.02)` in matplotlib.\n3.  **Fix Incorrect Chart Type:** The line plots in the bottom row (subplots (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2)) are statistically invalid as they connect discrete categories. Replace the 'Nitrate' line plot with a chart type suitable for categorical data, such as bar charts or box plots for each temperature category, plotted on the secondary y-axis.\n4.  **Color Consistency:** Use a single, consistent color for the 'Ammonia' bars across all three bottom subplots to allow for visual consistency. For example, use the dark slate gray from subplot (1, 0) for all three.\n5.  **Axis Scaling:** The y-axes for 'Average Ammonia' and 'Nitrate' have vastly different scales across the bottom row, making comparison impossible. If comparison is intended, consider using a consistent y-axis limit or a log scale. Add a note if scales are intentionally different.\n6.  **Text Hierarchy:** Improve readability by making the main title and subplot titles bold to create a clear visual hierarchy distinguishing them from axis labels and other text."
