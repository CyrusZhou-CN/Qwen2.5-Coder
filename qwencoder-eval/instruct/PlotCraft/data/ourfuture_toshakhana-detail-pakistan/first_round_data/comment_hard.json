    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to adhere to the specified chart types. The entire visualization should be regenerated using the correct composite charts requested in the prompt.\n\nAssuming the current chart types were to be improved:\n1. **Element Positioning and Spacing:** Use a constrained layout manager (like `plt.tight_layout()` or `GridSpec` with fine-tuned parameters) to ensure consistent and balanced spacing between all subplots and to prevent titles from being too close to the plots above them. The legend in subplot (2,2) should be moved closer to the plot, perhaps placed below it with a horizontal orientation.\n2. **Text Formatting Improvements:**\n   - **Subplot (0,1):** For the overlapping labels on the donut chart, use callout lines (annotations with arrows) to point to the smaller slices from an uncluttered area.\n   - **Subplot (0,2):** Correct the misspelled and truncated labels to 'President', 'Secretary', and 'Other Officials'.\n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Reformat the Y-axis tick labels to be integers (e.g., '2007' instead of '2007.0').\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** Correct the truncated radial axis labels to 'Bag, Jewellery/Accessories' and 'Books, Jewellery'.\n   - **General:** Ensure all text labels are complete and not truncated (e.g., 'Other Ministries' in (2,0)).\n3. **Color Scheme Enhancements:** Adopt a single, cohesive color palette for the entire 3x3 grid. For categorical data, use a qualitative palette (e.g., Tableau10, Set2) consistently. For sequential data (like in the heatmap), use a perceptually uniform colormap (e.g., 'viridis', 'cividis').\n4. **Legend and Annotation Optimizations:** In subplot (0,0), the legend is well-placed. In (1,1), a legend is missing. In (2,2), the legend is poorly placed. Legends should be consistently placed (e.g., 'upper right' or below the plot) across all subplots where applicable.\n5. **Layout Refinements:** Standardize the aspect ratio and size of the plotting areas for a more uniform and professional appearance. Ensure all titles are consistently aligned (e.g., all centered or all left-aligned)."
