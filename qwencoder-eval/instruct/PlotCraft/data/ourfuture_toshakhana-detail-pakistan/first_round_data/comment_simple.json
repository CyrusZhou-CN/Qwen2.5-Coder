    "improvement_suggestions": "The entire visualization needs to be recreated from scratch to meet the user's prompt. \n1. **Layout and Content:** Remove the sine wave plot (subplot (1, 0)) and the pie chart (subplot (2, 0)) entirely. The final output should be a single 1x1 chart.\n2. **Chart Type and Orientation:** Convert the chart from a vertical bar chart to a horizontal bar chart. The recipient names should be on the y-axis, and the total gift values should be on the x-axis.\n3. **Data Sorting:** Reorder the bars to be in descending order, with the recipient who received the highest value gift at the top of the chart.\n4. **Text Correction:**\n   - **Title:** Change the main title to be accurate, such as 'Top 15 Recipients by Total Value of Toshakhana Gifts'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Label the y-axis 'Recipient Name' and the x-axis 'Total Gift Value'.\n5. **Readability:** With a horizontal bar chart, the y-axis labels (recipient names) will become readable. Ensure the x-axis tick labels are formatted as proper monetary values (e.g., using commas like '700,000').\n6. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Adopt a professional style with a white background and remove the dark theme.\n   - Use subtle, light gray horizontal gridlines to guide the eye. Remove vertical gridlines.\n   - Make the chart title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n   - Remove the top and right chart borders (spines) for a cleaner, more modern look.\n7. **Color Scheme:** Replace the jarring lime green with a single, more professional color, such as a muted blue or gray."
