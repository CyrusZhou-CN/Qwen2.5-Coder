    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, focus on the following areas:\n1.  **Top Subplot (0, 0) - Color and Clarity:**\n    *   **Color Palette:** The most critical change is to replace the current color scheme with a qualitative palette that uses distinct, high-contrast colors for each gift category. This will make the segments of the stacked bars clearly visible and allow viewers to match them to the legend.\n    *   **X-axis Ticks:** Reformat the x-axis tick labels for better readability. Change the notation from '20000K' to a standard format like '20M' (for millions) or relabel the axis to 'Total Gift Value (in millions of Rs.)' and use ticks like '20', '40', '60'.\n2.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0) - Pie Chart:**\n    *   **Labels:** While the labels are good, consider using leader lines (callouts) to connect the text to each pie slice. This can improve clarity and prevent any potential for ambiguity, especially if slices were smaller.\n3.  **Overall Layout and Formatting:**\n    *   **Spacing:** Adjust the figure's aspect ratio or subplot parameters to reduce the excessive empty white space on the right side of the chart, creating a more balanced and compact layout.\n    *   **Title Hierarchy:** Make the main titles for each subplot bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy and distinguish them more clearly from the axis labels."
