# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the composition and distribution patterns of gifts in Pakistan's Toshakhana records. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) A stacked bar chart with overlaid line plot showing gift categories by recipient type and their cumulative values, (2) A pie chart with an inner donut chart displaying gift value composition by country/source with percentage annotations, (3) A treemap overlaid with bubble sizes representing gift frequency and value distribution across different government positions.

Middle row: (4) A horizontal stacked bar chart combined with error bars showing gift value ranges by year with trend indicators, (5) A violin plot merged with box plots displaying value distribution patterns across different gift types with outlier highlighting, (6) A waffle chart integrated with a small multiples approach showing gift composition percentages by different time periods or administrations.

Bottom row: (7) A sunburst-style nested pie chart combined with bar segments showing hierarchical breakdown of gifts by recipient→position→gift type, (8) A stacked area chart with scatter plot overlay tracking cumulative gift values over time with individual high-value gift markers, (9) A composite radar chart with filled areas and line plots comparing gift composition profiles across different government departments or officials.

Each subplot should include appropriate legends, value annotations, and color coding to reveal the complex composition patterns and hierarchical relationships within the Toshakhana gift data.
