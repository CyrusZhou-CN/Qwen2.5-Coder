# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of Toshakhana gifts by creating a 2x1 subplot layout. In the top subplot, display a horizontal stacked bar chart showing the distribution of gift types (categories) received by the top 5 recipients by total gift value, with each recipient as a separate bar and different gift categories as colored segments within each bar. In the bottom subplot, create a pie chart showing the overall composition of all gifts by their monetary value ranges (create 4-5 meaningful value brackets like "Under $1000", "$1000-$5000", "$5000-$20000", "Above $20000"), displaying both percentages and absolute counts for each segment.
