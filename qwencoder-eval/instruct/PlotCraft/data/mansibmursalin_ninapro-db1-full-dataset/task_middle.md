Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between EMG electrode signals and cyberglove sensor readings. Generate a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: scatter plot matrix showing correlations between the 4 most variable EMG channels (emg_5, emg_6, emg_7, emg_9) with correlation coefficients displayed, (2) Top-right: heatmap displaying correlation matrix between all 10 EMG channels, (3) Bottom-left: scatter plot of the two most correlated EMG-glove sensor pairs with best-fit lines, and (4) Bottom-right: bubble plot showing the relationship between average EMG activity (mean of all 10 EMG channels) vs average glove sensor activity (mean of glove_10 and glove_19 - the only variable glove sensors), with bubble sizes representing the variability (standard deviation) of EMG signals across channels.
