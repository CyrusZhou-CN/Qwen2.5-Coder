    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address any aspect of the user's prompt. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. A compliant and high-quality chart should be generated by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Layout and Structure:**\n    *   Implement a 2x2 subplot grid. Use `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)` to create the correct structure.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the bar chart with a scatter plot matrix (e.g., using `pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix`).\n    *   **Data:** Plot the specified EMG channels: `emg_5`, `emg_6`, `emg_7`, `emg_9`.\n    *   **Content:** Add annotations to display the correlation coefficients within the matrix.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the stacked area chart with a heatmap (e.g., using `seaborn.heatmap`).\n    *   **Data:** Use the correlation matrix for all 10 EMG channels.\n    *   **Formatting:** Use a clear, sequential, or diverging colormap (e.g., 'viridis' or 'coolwarm') and add a color bar.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** This subplot is missing. Create a scatter plot.\n    *   **Data:** Identify and plot the two most correlated EMG-glove sensor pairs.\n    *   **Content:** Add a best-fit regression line for each pair to show the trend.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the pie chart with a bubble plot (a scatter plot where point size is a third variable).\n    *   **Data:** Set the x-axis to the mean of all EMG channels, the y-axis to the mean of `glove_10` and `glove_19`, and the bubble size to the standard deviation of the EMG signals.\n\n6.  **Overall Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background & Colors:** Use a standard white background. Replace the neon colors with a professional, muted color palette. Ensure high contrast between text/data and the background (e.g., black text on white background).\n    *   **Text and Labels:** Provide accurate and descriptive titles for the entire figure and for each subplot that reflect the prompt's requirements. Ensure all axes are correctly labeled (e.g., 'Average EMG Activity'). Remove all overlapping and nonsensical placeholder text.\n    *   **Clarity:** Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Use functions like `plt.tight_layout()` to optimize spacing between subplots."
