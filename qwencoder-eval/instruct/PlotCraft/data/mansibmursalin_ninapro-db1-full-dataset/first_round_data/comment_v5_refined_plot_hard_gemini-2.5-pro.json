    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards. \n1. **Layout Restructuring:** Re-create the entire figure using a strict 3x3 grid structure (e.g., using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(3, 3)`). All subplots should be properly aligned and have consistent sizing to create a balanced and professional layout. \n2. **Complete Missing Plots:** Generate and include the two missing subplots: \n   - In subplot (0, 0): A scatter plot of `emg_5` vs `emg_6` with a regression line and marginal histograms. \n   - In subplot (1, 0): A scatter plot of `glove_10` vs `glove_19` with a regression line and confidence intervals. \n3. **Correct Network Graph:** The network graph in subplot (2, 1) must be completely redrawn. It should display edges connecting the EMG nodes to the glove sensor nodes. The thickness of these edges must be mapped to the strength of the correlation between the connected nodes. \n4. **Refine EMG-Glove Plot:** The large plot showing the polynomial fit and the separate residuals plot should be condensed to fit into the 3x3 grid. Place the main scatter plot with the polynomial fit into the designated subplot (2, 0). The residual plot should either be omitted or integrated more cleverly if space allows, but not by breaking the grid layout. \n5. **Improve Text and Spacing:** Use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust subplot spacing to prevent all text elements (titles, axis labels) from being cut off or overlapping. Increase the font size for the heatmap's y-axis tick labels for better readability. Correct the title of the network graph to properly display special characters. \n6. **Implement Consistent Color Scheme:** Establish and apply a consistent color palette across the entire figure to fulfill the prompt's requirement. For example, use shades of blue for all EMG-only plots (row 1), shades of orange for all glove-only plots (row 2), and shades of purple for all cross-modal EMG-glove plots (row 3). \n7. **Standardize Annotations:** Ensure all statistical annotations are placed consistently (e.g., top-left corner) and use a background color (or transparency) that provides high contrast and readability on all subplot backgrounds."
