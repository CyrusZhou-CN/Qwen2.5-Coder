To meet the user's request, a new chart should be generated with the following characteristics:\n1.  **Chart Type & Layout:** Create a single histogram in a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data & Formatting:** The histogram should represent the distribution of the 'emg_7' column. It must have exactly 15 bins. The bars of the histogram should be colored blue with a 70% transparency (alpha=0.7).\n3.  **Text Elements:** \n    *   The main title should be 'Distribution of EMG Signals from Electrode 7'.\n    *   The x-axis should be labeled 'EMG Signal Value'.\n    *   The y-axis should be labeled 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n4.  **Professional Standards:** The chart should have a white background. If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and subtle. The title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
