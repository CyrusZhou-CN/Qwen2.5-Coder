    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data Correction and Sorting:** The most critical issue is the data itself. Remove the 'Total' bar entirely as it is not a country and its scale distorts the chart. The chart must be updated to show the correct top 15 countries and sorted in **descending** order, with the country having the most cases at the top.\n2. **Color Scheme Adjustment:** Once the sorting is corrected, reverse the color gradient. The country with the highest number of cases at the top should have the most prominent color (e.g., dark purple/blue), and the colors should become progressively lighter for countries with fewer cases.\n3. **Axis Label Formatting:** Improve the readability of the x-axis by formatting the tick labels to avoid scientific notation. For example, display '100,000,000' or use abbreviations like '100M', '200M', etc.\n4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Enhance the visual hierarchy by making the chart title bold. This will clearly distinguish it as the primary header for the visualization.\n5. **Data Labels:** Ensure the data labels for each bar remain clearly visible and do not overlap after adding the additional countries and re-sorting."
