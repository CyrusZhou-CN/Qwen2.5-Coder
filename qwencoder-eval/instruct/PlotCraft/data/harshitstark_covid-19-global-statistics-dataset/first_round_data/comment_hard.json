    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet both task requirements and quality standards. \n\n**1. Fulfill Task Requirements:**\n- **Subplot (0,0):** Add the scatter plot layer for 'New Cases', ensuring the point sizes are mapped to the data as intended.\n- **Subplot (1,0):** Add the confidence interval bands around the regression line.\n- **Subplot (1,1):** Overlay a swarm plot or jitter plot to show the individual data points as requested.\n- **Subplot (1,2):** Re-implement this as a pair-plot matrix, with the correlation heatmap in the upper triangle and scatter plots in the lower triangle.\n- **Subplot (2,0):** Redraw as a proper diverging bar chart with a central axis at zero.\n- **Subplot (2,1):** Add the specified markers for serious/critical case proportions and increase the country count from 15 to 20.\n- **Subplot (2,2):** Increase the country count from 6 to 10 as specified.\n- **All Subplots:** Add meaningful text annotations to highlight a key insight in each chart.\n\n**2. Improve Formatting and Layout:**\n- **Global Style:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready style: use a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines. Add a main figure title (e.g., 'Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic Progression').\n- **Spacing:** Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)` to create consistent, adequate spacing between all subplots, preventing titles and labels from overlapping.\n- **Text Hierarchy:** Make subplot titles bold and a larger font size than axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n\n**3. Enhance Clarity and Readability:**\n- **Axis Labels:** For plots with overlapping x-axis labels (e.g., top row), consider using horizontal bar charts or reducing the number of data points to ensure every label is readable.\n- **Subplot (1,2):** Adjust plot margins to prevent the y-axis labels from being cut off.\n- **Subplot (2,2):** Move the legend outside the plot area (e.g., using `bbox_to_anchor`) to avoid overlap with the title and chart.\n\n**4. Refine Color Scheme:**\n- **Consistency:** Establish a consistent, thematic color palette. For instance, consistently use one color for 'Cases', another for 'Deaths', and a third for 'Tests' across all relevant subplots to aid comparison.\n- **Palette Choice:** Replace the default multi-color palettes in subplots (2,1) and (2,2) with a curated, colorblind-friendly palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer or Viridis)."
