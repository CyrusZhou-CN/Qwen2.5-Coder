    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, several critical changes are needed:\n1.  **Correct the Scatter Plot Data:** The scatter plot must be re-plotted to show the relationship between 'total cases per million' and 'deaths per million' as requested. This is a fundamental data representation error. A possible implementation is to add a secondary x-axis at the top for 'Total Cases per Million' and use that for the scatter points' x-coordinates, while their y-positions remain aligned with the countries on the primary y-axis.\n2.  **Display Y-Axis Labels:** The y-axis must display the names of the countries. Without these labels, the chart is uninterpretable. To accommodate the large number of labels, either increase the figure's height significantly or consider plotting a meaningful subset of the data (e.g., the top 20 and bottom 20 countries by deviation).\n3.  **Fix Annotation Overlap:** The annotations for the top and bottom 5 countries are unreadable. Use a text-repelling algorithm (like the `adjustText` library in Python) to automatically position the labels to avoid overlap. Alternatively, use leader lines or arrows to connect non-overlapping labels to their corresponding data points.\n4.  **Remove Redundant Y-Axis:** The secondary y-axis on the right ('Countries (Cases/1M scale)') is confusing and should be removed entirely.\n5.  **Increase Bar Visibility:** The horizontal bars in the diverging bar chart are extremely thin. Increase their thickness (e.g., by adjusting the `height` parameter in a horizontal bar plot) to make them clearly visible as bars rather than lines.\n6.  **Refine Layout and Spacing:** Adjust the overall figure layout to provide more space for the y-axis labels and prevent the legend from being placed too far from the plot area. A wider aspect ratio might also improve the visual presentation of the data distribution."
