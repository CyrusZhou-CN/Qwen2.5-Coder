## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing COVID-19 pandemic progression and impact patterns. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): Focus on case progression patterns
- Subplot 1: Combine a line chart showing total cases per million population over countries (ranked) with overlaid scatter points indicating new cases, plus error bars showing the range of active cases
- Subplot 2: Create a dual-axis plot with bar chart showing total deaths per million and a line plot overlay showing the death-to-case ratio, with a secondary y-axis
- Subplot 3: Develop a stacked area chart showing the composition of total cases (recovered, deaths, active) with a line plot overlay tracking recovery rates

Middle row (3 subplots): Focus on testing and demographic relationships  
- Subplot 4: Construct a scatter plot with bubble sizes representing population, x-axis as tests per million, y-axis as cases per million, with a regression line and confidence intervals
- Subplot 5: Build a violin plot showing the distribution of cases per million across different population density categories (create bins), overlaid with box plots and individual data points
- Subplot 6: Design a correlation heatmap combined with scatter plots in the lower triangle showing relationships between testing rates, case rates, death rates, and recovery rates

Bottom row (3 subplots): Focus on severity and critical care patterns
- Subplot 7: Create a diverging bar chart showing countries above/below median death rates, combined with lollipop plots indicating serious/critical cases per total cases
- Subplot 8: Develop a slope chart connecting total cases to total deaths for top 20 affected countries, with additional markers showing serious/critical case proportions
- Subplot 9: Construct a radar chart comparing top 10 countries across multiple metrics (cases/1M, deaths/1M, tests/1M, recovery rate) with overlaid line plots connecting each country's performance profile

Each subplot must include appropriate legends, titles, and annotations highlighting key insights. Use consistent color schemes across related metrics and ensure all numerical data is properly parsed from string format.
