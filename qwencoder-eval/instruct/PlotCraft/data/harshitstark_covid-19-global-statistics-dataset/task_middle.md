# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals how different countries deviate from global COVID-19 mortality patterns. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a diverging bar chart showing each country's death rate per million population as deviations from the global median death rate, with bars extending left (below median) and right (above median) from a central zero line, and (2) an overlaid scatter plot on the same axes showing the relationship between total cases per million and deaths per million, with point sizes representing population size. Color-code countries by continent or region if identifiable from country names, and highlight the top 5 and bottom 5 countries in terms of deviation from the median death rate with distinct markers or annotations.
