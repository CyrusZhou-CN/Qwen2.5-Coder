# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive distribution analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left subplot, create a histogram with overlaid KDE curve showing the distribution of the 'aa_000' feature for both positive ('pos') and negative ('neg') classes using different colors and transparency. In the top-right subplot, create a violin plot comparing the distributions of 'ag_004', 'ag_005', and 'ag_006' features across the two classes. In the bottom-left subplot, create a box plot matrix showing the distribution patterns of 'az_000', 'az_001', 'az_002', and 'az_003' features grouped by class. In the bottom-right subplot, create a ridge plot (joy plot) style visualization showing the density distributions of 'ee_000', 'ee_001', 'ee_002', and 'ee_003' features stacked vertically with different colors for each class. Handle missing values appropriately and ensure proper scaling for meaningful comparisons across the highly imbalanced dataset.
