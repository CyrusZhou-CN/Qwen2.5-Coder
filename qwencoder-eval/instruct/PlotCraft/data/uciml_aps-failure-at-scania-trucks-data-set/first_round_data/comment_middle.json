    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address any part of the user's prompt. It cannot be improved; it must be discarded and recreated from scratch. A correct implementation should follow these steps:\n1.  **Start Over:** The current visualization is unsalvageable. A new chart must be generated that follows the original prompt.\n2.  **Layout:** Create a proper 2x2 subplot grid using a function like `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)`.\n3.  **Chart Implementation (per subplot):**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Generate a histogram for the 'aa_000' feature. Overlay a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve. Use two distinct, semi-transparent colors to represent the 'pos' and 'neg' classes.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Generate a violin plot to compare the distributions of 'ag_004', 'ag_005', and 'ag_006'. Group the data by class to show separate violins for 'pos' and 'neg' for each feature.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Generate a set of box plots for 'az_000', 'az_001', 'az_002', and 'az_003'. Group the box plots by class for direct comparison.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Generate a ridge plot (joy plot) for 'ee_000', 'ee_001', 'ee_002', and 'ee_003'. Each feature should have its own density plot, with overlapping distributions colored differently for each class.\n4.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a standard white background for clarity and professionalism.\n    *   Select a clean, professional color palette with good contrast for accessibility. Avoid the harsh neon colors on a black background.\n    *   Ensure all titles and labels are accurate, descriptive, and correctly placed without any overlap. Provide a main title for the 2x2 grid and individual titles for each subplot that describe its content."
