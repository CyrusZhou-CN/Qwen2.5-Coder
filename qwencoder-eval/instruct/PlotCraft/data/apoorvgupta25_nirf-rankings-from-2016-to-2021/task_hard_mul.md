## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of NIRF rankings across different educational categories from 2016-2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

1. Top-left: Engineering rankings - Create a multi-line time series plot showing the score trajectories of the top 5 consistently ranked engineering institutes over years, overlaid with a filled area chart showing the score range (min-max) across all ranked institutes for each year.

2. Top-right: Management rankings - Develop a slope chart connecting 2016 and 2021 scores for the top 10 management institutes, with scatter points sized by their respective TLR (Teaching, Learning & Resources) scores and colored by their final 2021 ranking position.

3. Middle-left: Medical vs Dental comparison - Construct a dual-axis time series where the primary axis shows the average scores of top 10 medical institutes as a line chart with confidence bands, and the secondary axis displays the count of dental institutes participating each year as a bar chart.

4. Middle-right: University category analysis - Build a stacked area chart showing the cumulative distribution of universities across different score ranges (0-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100) over the years, with trend lines indicating the movement of median scores.

5. Bottom-left: Research institute performance - Create a combination of box plots showing score distributions for each year connected by violin plots, overlaid with individual trajectory lines for institutes that appeared in all available years.

6. Bottom-right: Overall ranking stability - Design a heatmap-style visualization showing rank changes over time for the top 20 overall ranked institutes, with additional line plots showing the coefficient of variation in scores across different ranking parameters (TLR, RPC, GO, OI, Perception) over the years.
