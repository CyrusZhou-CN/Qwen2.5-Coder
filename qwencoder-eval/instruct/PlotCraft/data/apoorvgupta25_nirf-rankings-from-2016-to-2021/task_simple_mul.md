Create a line chart showing the evolution of overall scores over time (2016-2021) for the top 10 institutes that appear consistently across all years in the OverallRanking.csv dataset. Display each institute as a separate line with different colors, include a legend, and add markers to highlight data points. The chart should clearly show how these leading institutes' performance has changed over the 6-year period.
