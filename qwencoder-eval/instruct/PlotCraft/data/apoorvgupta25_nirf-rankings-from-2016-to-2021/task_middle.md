## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Indian institutes' performance across different ranking categories from 2016 to 2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Engineering rankings - Create a line chart showing the trend of average TLR (Teaching, Learning & Resources) scores over years, overlaid with a scatter plot showing individual institute performance, and add error bars representing the standard deviation of scores each year.

Top-right: Management rankings - Develop an area chart displaying the distribution of GO (Graduation Outcomes) scores across years, combined with a line plot showing the median GO score trend, and include a secondary y-axis showing the count of institutes ranked each year.

Bottom-left: Medical rankings - Design a combination of stacked bar chart showing the composition of score components (TLR, RPC, GO, OI) for the top 5 institutes in 2021, overlaid with line plots tracking each component's trend over the years for these same institutes.

Bottom-right: Overall rankings - Create a slope chart connecting institutes' ranks between 2016 and 2021 for the top 20 institutes, combined with a background heatmap showing the correlation matrix between different scoring parameters across all years.

Use consistent color schemes across subplots, add appropriate legends, and ensure each visualization tells a story about how Indian higher education institutions have evolved over this 6-year period.
