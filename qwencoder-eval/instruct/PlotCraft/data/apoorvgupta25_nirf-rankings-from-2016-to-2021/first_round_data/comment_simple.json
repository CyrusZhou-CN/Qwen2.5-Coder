    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the user's request and professional standards.\n1.  **Task Compliance:**\n    *   Create a single horizontal bar chart (`plt.barh()`) instead of two vertical ones.\n    *   Place the institute names on the y-axis and their scores on the x-axis.\n    *   Sort the data in descending order by score before plotting, so the institute with the highest score is at the top.\n2.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    *   Use a professional and clean style. Set the background color to white and use subtle, light gray gridlines for the x-axis only.\n    *   Remove the thick, brightly colored borders from the bars. Use a single, solid color for all bars, such as a muted blue or gray.\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Replace the current titles with a single, informative title like 'Top 15 Institutes by Overall Ranking Score (2021)'. Make the title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n    *   Use accurate axis labels: 'Institute' for the y-axis and 'Overall Score' for the x-axis.\n    *   Ensure all institute names on the y-axis are fully visible and legible. Adjust the left margin if necessary (`plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.3)`).\n    *   Remove the nonsensical legends ('Glarbnok's Revenge'). A legend is not needed for a single-series bar chart."
