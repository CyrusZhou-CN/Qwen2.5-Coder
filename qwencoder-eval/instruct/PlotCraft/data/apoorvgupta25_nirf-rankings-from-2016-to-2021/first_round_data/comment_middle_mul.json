    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and needs to be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Correct the Layout:** Implement a 2x2 subplot grid using `plt.subplots(2, 2)`. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to ensure proper spacing between plots and prevent any overlap of titles or labels.\n2.  **Use Correct Data and Text:** The entire dataset and all text elements (titles, axis labels, legends) must be replaced to reflect the task of analyzing Indian institutes' rankings from 2016-2021.\n3.  **Implement Subplots Correctly:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a line chart for average TLR, a scatter plot for the top 5 institutes' TLR, and error bars for the standard deviation. Title it 'Engineering: TLR Score Trends'.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a dual-axis chart. On the primary axis, plot a line for average GO scores. On the secondary axis, plot a bar chart for the count of institutes with GO > 90. Title it 'Management: Graduation Outcome Analysis'.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Create a stacked area chart for the four specified RPC score ranges. Overlay a distinct line for the median RPC score. Title it 'University: RPC Score Distribution'.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create a line plot for the average overall score, overlaid with violin plots for each year's score distribution. Add two separate trend lines for the top 10 and bottom 10 institutes. Title it 'Overall Rankings: Score Distribution and Trends'.\n4.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a white background for the figure and plots. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle.\n    *   **Colors:** Select a professional and harmonious color palette. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors. Ensure good contrast for all elements.\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. Make subplot titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels. Ensure all text is legible.\n    *   **Legends:** Place legends in a consistent location, preferably outside the plot area, to avoid obscuring data."
