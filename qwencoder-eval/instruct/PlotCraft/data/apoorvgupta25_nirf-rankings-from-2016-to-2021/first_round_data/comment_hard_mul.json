    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several changes are needed to meet the task requirements and enhance quality:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Re-implement the chart to correctly encode the data. The size of the scatter points should be mapped to the 'TLR' scores, and their color should be mapped to the '2021 ranking position'. Add a color bar to explain the rank coloring.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** This chart needs to be completely redone. It should display a series of box plots (one for each year from 2016-2021) to show the score distribution over time. These should be connected by violin plots, and individual trajectory lines for consistently ranked institutes should be overlaid.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Add the missing line plots for 'TLR CV', 'RPC CV', 'GO CV', 'OI CV', and 'Perception CV' to the secondary y-axis. The existing legend should correspond to these new lines.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the overall figure size and use a function like `fig.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)` to create more generous spacing between subplots. This will prevent titles, axes, and plots from appearing cramped.\n\n3.  **Text and Legends:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0) & (2, 1):** Address the truncated text. For the legend in (0, 0) and y-axis labels in (2, 1), use standard abbreviations for the institutes (e.g., 'IIT Madras', 'IIT Delhi') to ensure they are fully readable.\n    *   **All Subplots:** Remove the unprofessional `**` characters from all titles.\n\n4.  **Color and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Change the 'Median Score' line. Make it thinner and use a more neutral color (e.g., dark gray or black) with a dashed style to create a visual accent that doesn't clash with the stacked area colors.\n    *   **Overall:** Adopt a single, consistent color palette across all six subplots to create a cohesive and professional-looking dashboard.\n\n5.  **Clarity:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** To resolve the overlap, set the `alpha` (transparency) of the orange bars to a value like `0.6` so that the line chart and its confidence band are visible through them."
