    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Fundamental Redesign:** Replace the 2x5 grid of subplots with a single (1x1) line chart. All 10 institutes should be plotted as separate lines on this one chart to enable direct comparison of their performance over time.\n2. **Correct Chart Type:** Remove the bar charts entirely. The visualization should only consist of lines with markers as requested.\n3. **Fix Axes:** The x-axis must represent 'Year' (from 2016 to 2021), and the y-axis must represent 'Overall Score'. This is crucial for correctly displaying a time-series trend.\n4. **Update Text Content:** All text must be replaced with meaningful information. The main title should be descriptive, such as 'Performance of Top 10 Institutes Over Time (2016-2021)'. The axis labels should be 'Year' and 'Overall Score'.\n5. **Implement a Proper Legend:** Create a single legend for the chart that clearly maps each colored line to the corresponding institute's name. Place it in a non-obstructive location, like the upper-right corner or outside the plot area.\n6. **Improve Color Palette:** Discard the current neon color scheme. Use a professional, qualitative color palette with distinct, visually pleasing colors that have good contrast (e.g., Seaborn's 'colorblind' or Matplotlib's 'tab10' palettes).\n7. **Professional Formatting:** Switch to a clean, publication-ready format. Use a white background, subtle light-gray gridlines, and create a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
