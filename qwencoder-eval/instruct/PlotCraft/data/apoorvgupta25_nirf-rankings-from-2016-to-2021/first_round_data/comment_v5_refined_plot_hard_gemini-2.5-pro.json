    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following changes are recommended:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** This subplot must be completely remade to meet the prompt. It should display a slope chart for the top 20 individual institutes (not aggregated categories) between 2020 and 2021. Add scatter points at the start and end of each line, coloring the points by the institute's category. The line thickness should be mapped to the magnitude of the institute's *score* change. The y-axis must be inverted and use integer ticks for ranks.\n\n2.  **Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n    *   **Global Style:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready aesthetic. Set the figure and all axes backgrounds to white. \n    *   **Gridlines:** Change the gridlines to be subtle, using a light gray color (e.g., '#cccccc') and a dashed line style to avoid distracting from the data.\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clearer visual hierarchy. Ensure subplot titles are bold and slightly larger than axis labels. Axis labels should be slightly larger than tick labels.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Layout Refinements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** To reduce clutter, increase the `zorder` of the dashed line plots to ensure they are drawn cleanly on top of the stacked area chart. Use more distinct colors or add unique markers for each of the five state trend lines to improve their traceability.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** To prevent overlap, ensure the line plots have a higher `zorder` than the bar plots. Consider slightly reducing the size of the line markers.\n    *   **Axes:** Add a small amount of padding between the right-hand y-axis labels and the plot border in subplots (1, 0) and (1, 1) to improve spacing.\n\n4.  **Legend and Text:**\n    *   **Consistency:** For a more cohesive dashboard look, consider placing all legends in a consistent location, such as the top-right corner of each subplot, if space permits without overlap."
