    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul as it fails to meet the prompt's requirements and is visually broken. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Fix Broken Subplots:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1) - Management:** The fundamental issue is the swapped axes. 'Year' must be on the x-axis and 'GO Score' on the y-axis. Re-implement the area chart to show a distribution over time (e.g., by plotting percentile bands) and overlay the median line plot correctly. The secondary y-axis for 'Institute Count' should align with the years on the new x-axis.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0) - Medical:** This plot is completely compressed. It needs to be a proper stacked bar chart with 5 distinct categories on the x-axis (for the top 5 institutes). The current single bar for '#5' is incorrect. The request to overlay line plots of trends is overly complex and likely caused the error; a better approach would be to create a separate chart for the trends or simplify the visualization.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1) - Overall:** The slope chart's x-axis must be corrected to show the range from **2016** to 2021. The background 'heatmap' is not a heatmap. It should be replaced with a proper 2D correlation matrix (e.g., a 4x4 grid for TLR, RPC, GO, OI) where color intensity represents the correlation coefficient.\n\n2.  **Resolve Overlaps and Layout Issues:**\n    *   Use a layout manager (like `plt.tight_layout()` or `constrained_layout=True` in matplotlib) to automatically adjust spacing and prevent the main title from overlapping with subplot titles.\n    *   Ensure all subplots have a reasonable aspect ratio. The extreme horizontal compression of subplots (0, 1) and (1, 0) must be fixed so the data is visible.\n    *   In subplot (1, 1), reposition the legends. Place the line-type legend ('Rank Improved', etc.) in a corner of the plot area and ensure the color bar for the (future) heatmap does not obscure any axis labels or data.\n\n3.  **Improve Text and Labels:**\n    *   Correct all axis labels and tick marks, especially the swapped axes in (0, 1) and the incorrect years in (1, 1).\n    *   The unreadable, overlapping tick labels on the right y-axis of subplot (1, 0) will likely be resolved when the plot's compression is fixed, but they should be checked for clarity.\n    *   Clarify the purpose of the 'OI', 'GO', 'RPC', 'TLR' labels on the right of subplot (1, 1). If they are intended to label the rows of the heatmap, they should be aligned with those rows."
