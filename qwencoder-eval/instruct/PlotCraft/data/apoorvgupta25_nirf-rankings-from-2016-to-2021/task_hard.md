## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Indian educational institutions' NIRF rankings from 2016-2021. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Create a multi-layered time series showing the average scores over years for the top 3 categories (Engineering, Medical, Management) with both line plots for trends and filled area charts showing score ranges (min-max bands) for each category.

Top-right: Develop a slope chart overlaid with scatter points showing rank changes between 2020 and 2021 for the top 20 institutes across all categories, where line thickness represents the magnitude of score change and scatter point colors indicate the category type.

Bottom-left: Construct a stacked area chart showing the composition of total institutes participating each year by state, overlaid with line plots tracking the performance trends (average scores) of the top 5 performing states over time.

Bottom-right: Design a combination chart with grouped bar plots showing yearly count of institutes by ranking tiers (1-10, 11-25, 26-50, 51-100) overlaid with line plots displaying the year-over-year percentage change in average TLR (Teaching, Learning & Resources) and RPC (Research and Professional Practice) scores across all categories.
