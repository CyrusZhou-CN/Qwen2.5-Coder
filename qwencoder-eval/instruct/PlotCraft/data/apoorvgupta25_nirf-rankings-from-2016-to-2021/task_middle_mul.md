## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Indian institutes' performance across different ranking categories from 2016 to 2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Engineering rankings - Create a line chart showing the trend of average TLR (Teaching, Learning & Resources) scores over years, overlaid with a scatter plot highlighting the top 5 institutes' individual TLR trajectories, and add error bars showing the standard deviation of TLR scores for each year.

Top-right: Management rankings - Develop a dual-axis chart with a line plot showing the average GO (Graduation Outcomes) scores trend over time on the primary axis, and a bar chart displaying the count of institutes achieving GO scores above 90 for each year on the secondary axis.

Bottom-left: University rankings - Construct an area chart showing the distribution of RPC (Research and Professional Practice) score ranges (0-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100) as stacked areas over the years, with a line overlay indicating the median RPC score trend.

Bottom-right: Overall rankings - Design a combination chart with a line plot tracking the average overall scores by year, overlaid with a violin plot showing the score distribution for each year, and include trend lines for the top 10 and bottom 10 institutes separately.
