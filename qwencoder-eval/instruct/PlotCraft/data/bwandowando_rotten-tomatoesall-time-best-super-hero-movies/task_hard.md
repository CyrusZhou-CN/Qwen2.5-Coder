# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the relationships between critical reception, audience reception, and temporal patterns in superhero movies. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Create a scatter plot with marginal histograms showing the correlation between Tomatometer scores and Audience scores, with points colored by release decade and sized by number of critic reviews; (2) Top-right: Generate a dual-axis plot combining a line chart of average Tomatometer scores over time with a bar chart overlay showing the count of movies released per year, including trend lines for both metrics; (3) Bottom-left: Construct a correlation heatmap overlaid with a network graph showing relationships between numerical variables (scores, review counts, runtime if available), with correlation coefficients displayed and network edges weighted by correlation strength; (4) Bottom-right: Design a bubble chart examining the three-way relationship between Tomatometer score, Audience score, and total review volume (critic + user reviews), with bubbles colored by movie ranking and trend surfaces fitted to reveal patterns in critical vs popular success relative to review engagement.
