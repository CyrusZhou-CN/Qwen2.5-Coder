# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between critical and audience reception of superhero movies. Design a scatter plot with Tomatometer scores on the x-axis and audience scores on the y-axis, where each point represents a movie. Overlay this scatter plot with a regression line to show the correlation trend. Additionally, use color coding to distinguish between different decades of movie releases, and vary the point sizes based on the number of critic reviews each movie received. Include appropriate legends and annotations to highlight any notable outliers or patterns in the critic-audience score relationship.
