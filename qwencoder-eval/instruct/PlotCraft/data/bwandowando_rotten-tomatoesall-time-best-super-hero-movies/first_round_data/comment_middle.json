    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete. The primary issue is the complete lack of data visualization. To meet the task requirements and create a high-quality chart, the following steps are essential:\n1.  **Plot the Data:** The most critical step is to plot the movie data on the scatter plot. Each point should represent a movie, with its x-coordinate being the 'Tomatometer Score' and its y-coordinate being the 'Audience Score'.\n2.  **Add Regression Line:** Overlay a regression line on the scatter plot to visualize the correlation trend between critic and audience scores.\n3.  **Implement Encoding:** \n    *   **Color:** Assign a distinct color to the data points based on the decade of the movie's release. Add a corresponding legend to explain the color-to-decade mapping.\n    *   **Size:** Vary the size of the data points based on the number of critic reviews. The existing legend for 'Review Volume' is a good start but is useless without the actual sized points.\n4.  **Correct Axis Labels:** The axis labels must be corrected for clarity and professionalism. Change 'Critic Score (isTopCritic)' to 'Critic Score (Tomatometer %)' and 'Audience Score (reviewUrl)' to 'Audience Score (%)'.\n5.  **Add Annotations:** After plotting the data, identify any significant outliers (e.g., movies with a large discrepancy between critic and audience scores) or distinct clusters and add text annotations with arrows to highlight them, as requested in the prompt."
