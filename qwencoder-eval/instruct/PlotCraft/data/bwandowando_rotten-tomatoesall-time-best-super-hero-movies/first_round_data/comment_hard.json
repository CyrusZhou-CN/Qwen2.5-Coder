    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart fails to meet every aspect of the user's prompt and requires a complete re-creation from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Layout:** Create a proper 2x2 subplot grid using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)`.\n2.  **Data and Content:** Use data relevant to superhero movies as specified in the prompt. All titles, axis labels, and legends must be corrected to reflect this data (e.g., 'Correlation of Tomatometer and Audience Scores', 'Average Tomatometer Score Over Time').\n3.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the pie chart with a scatter plot with marginal histograms. Set the x-axis to 'Tomatometer Score' and the y-axis to 'Audience Score'. Encode points by color for 'Release Decade' and by size for 'Number of Critic Reviews'.\n4.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the stacked bar chart with a dual-axis plot. The primary y-axis should show a line chart of 'Average Tomatometer Score' over time. The secondary y-axis (created with `ax.twinx()`) should show a bar chart of 'Number of Movies Released' per year. Add trend lines to both series.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 0):** While a heatmap is present, it needs to be corrected. The data should be a correlation matrix of the specified movie variables. The overlaid network graph needs to be larger, clearer, and positioned so it doesn't obscure the heatmap's values. Consider placing it in an inset axis for clarity.\n6.  **Subplot (1, 1):** Add the missing fourth subplot. This should be a bubble chart where x='Tomatometer Score', y='Audience Score', bubble size='Total Review Volume', and bubble color='Movie Ranking'.\n7.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   **Color:** Discard the current neon palette. Use a professional, cohesive color scheme, such as a perceptually uniform colormap from `matplotlib.cm` (e.g., 'viridis', 'plasma') or a standard `seaborn` palette.\n    *   **Clarity:** Eliminate all element overlaps. Ensure legends are placed in empty space or outside the plot area. Increase the font size of any unreadable text.\n    *   **Professional Standards:** Use a white background for all plots. Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title of each subplot bold and slightly larger than the axis labels. Use subtle, light-gray gridlines if needed."
