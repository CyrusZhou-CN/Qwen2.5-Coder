    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and needs to be created from scratch. \n1. **Adhere to the Task:** Create a single (1x1) histogram showing the distribution of 'Tomatometer scores'. Set the number of bins to 15 as requested.\n2. **Correct Labeling:** The main title should be 'Distribution of Tomatometer Scores for Superhero Movies'. The x-axis should be labeled 'Tomatometer Score' and the y-axis 'Frequency' (or 'Number of Movies').\n3. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a standard white background, not black.\n   - Remove the thick, neon-colored borders around the plot. Use subtle, thin, gray axis lines (spines).\n   - Use a single, professional color for the histogram bars, such as a muted blue or gray, instead of the current jarring colors.\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title larger and bolder than the axis labels.\n4. **Clarity:** Ensure there are no watermarks or overlapping elements. All text should be clearly legible and correctly placed."
