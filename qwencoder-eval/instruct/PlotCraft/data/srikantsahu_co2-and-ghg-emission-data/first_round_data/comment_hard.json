    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary need is to fulfill the complex requirements of the prompt. Beyond that, several visual and formatting improvements are necessary:\n\n1.  **Task Fulfillment:** Revisit every subplot to implement the missing chart components. For instance:\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** Add the bar chart for decadal growth rates and fix the x-axis to show all decades from 1950 to 2010. Rescale the left y-axis to make the data visible.\n    *   **Subplot (0,2):** Overlay the specified contour lines on the heatmap.\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** Add the connected scatter plot of emission velocity changes.\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** Add the partial autocorrelation (PACF) plot alongside the ACF plot.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** Combine the calendar heatmap with the requested time series plot and moving average overlay.\n\n2.  **Text and Labeling:**\n    *   **Global:** Adjust the layout padding (e.g., using `tight_layout`) to ensure no text labels are cut off.\n    *   **Subplot (0,2) & (1,2):** Ensure full country/region names are displayed on the y-axis (e.g., 'Afghanistan', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Europe').\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** Correct the x-axis to show the range up to 2019 as requested, not 2017.\n\n3.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** This plot needs a complete overhaul. The x-axis must be populated with decadal ticks, and the y-axis range for 'Growth Rate (%)' must be adjusted to the data's actual range to avoid compressing the visualization into a flat line.\n\n4.  **Data Representation:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** The black trend lines are very thick, causing them to merge at the beginning of the timeline. Reduce their line width for better clarity."
