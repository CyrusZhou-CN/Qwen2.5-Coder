Here are the steps to create the correct visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x1 subplot layout (two rows, one column).\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top Plot:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Change from a bar chart to a **line chart**.\n    *   **Data:** Plot the CO2 emissions for the top 5 emitting countries from 1950 to 2019.\n    *   **Axes:** The x-axis should represent 'Year' (1950-2019), and the y-axis should represent 'CO2 Emissions' (with appropriate units, e.g., 'in Million Tonnes').\n    *   **Styling:** Use five distinct and easily distinguishable colors for each country's line. Add markers to each data point to improve clarity.\n    *   **Text:** The title should be specific, such as 'Annual CO2 Emissions of Top 5 Emitters (1950-2019)'. Add a legend that clearly maps each color to the correct country name.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom Plot:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Change from a pie/scatter plot to a **stacked area chart**.\n    *   **Data:** Use the same data for the top 5 countries to show their cumulative contribution over time.\n    *   **Axes:** The x-axis should be 'Year', and the y-axis should represent 'Cumulative CO2 Emissions' or 'Share of Emissions'.\n    *   **Styling:** Use the same color scheme as the top plot for consistency.\n    *   **Text:** The title should be descriptive, such as 'Cumulative Contribution to CO2 Emissions by Top 5 Emitters'. Add a legend.\n4.  **Overall Formatting:**\n    *   **Background:** Change the background from black to **white** for a professional, publication-ready appearance.\n    *   **Text:** Replace all placeholder text ('Glarbnok', 'Flimflam', etc.) with accurate and relevant labels, titles, and legends.\n    *   **Clarity:** Ensure no elements overlap. Adjust spacing between the two subplots to create a balanced and readable layout."
