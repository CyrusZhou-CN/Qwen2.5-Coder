    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and requires a total redesign to meet the user's prompt. The following are steps to create the correct chart from scratch:\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Prompt**: The fundamental issue is the complete disregard for the user's instructions. The correct chart must be a **line chart** visualizing **CO2 emissions** for the **top 5 countries** from **1950 to 2017**.\n\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type**: \n    *   Use a single (1x1) plot area.\n    *   Change the chart type from bar/pie charts to a **line chart**. The x-axis should represent 'Year' and the y-axis 'CO2 Emissions'.\n    *   Plot five distinct lines, one for each of the top 5 emitting countries.\n\n3.  **Text Content and Clarity**:\n    *   **Title**: Change the title to something informative, like \"Evolution of Annual CO2 Emissions for Top 5 Emitters (1950-2017)\". Make the title bold and slightly larger than other text for clear hierarchy.\n    *   **Axis Labels**: Change the x-axis label to \"Year\" and the y-axis label to \"Annual CO2 Emissions (tonnes)\" or another appropriate unit.\n    *   **Tick Labels**: Ensure the x-axis tick labels are readable. For the 1950-2017 range, display labels at 10-year intervals (e.g., 1950, 1960, 1970...) to prevent overlap.\n\n4.  **Legend**: \n    *   Implement a legend that clearly maps each colored line to its corresponding country name. Place it in a position that does not obscure the data, such as the upper-left corner or outside the plot area to the right.\n\n5.  **Color and Formatting**:\n    *   **Color Palette**: Replace the current harsh, neon-like colors with a professional, qualitative color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer or `seaborn.color_palette('muted')`). The colors should be distinct but harmonious.\n    *   **Professional Standards**: Switch to a clean, professional style. Use a white background (`plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')` or similar). If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and unobtrusive. Remove the top and right chart borders (spines) for a cleaner look."
