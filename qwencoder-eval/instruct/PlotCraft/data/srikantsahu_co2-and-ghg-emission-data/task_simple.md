## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of CO2 emissions over time from 1950 to 2017 for the top 5 countries with the highest emissions in 2017. The chart should display each country as a separate line with different colors, include a legend, and have proper axis labels. Focus on revealing how the emission trajectories of these major polluters have changed over the nearly 70-year period.
