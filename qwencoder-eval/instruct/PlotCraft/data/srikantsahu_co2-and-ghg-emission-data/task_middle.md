# Visualization Task - Middle

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the evolution of CO2 emissions from 1950 to 2019. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top subplot displays a line chart showing the emission trends of the top 5 highest emitting countries in 2019, with each country represented by a different colored line and markers. The bottom subplot should show a stacked area chart displaying the cumulative contribution of these same top 5 countries over time, illustrating how their relative contributions to global emissions have changed. Both plots should include proper legends, axis labels, and titles that highlight the dramatic acceleration of emissions during the industrial boom periods and recent decades.
