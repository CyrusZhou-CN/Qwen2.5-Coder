## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing global CO2 emission patterns from 1950-2019. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Line chart with confidence bands showing emission trends for top 5 emitting countries overlaid with a stacked area chart showing their cumulative contribution, (2) Dual-axis plot combining bar chart of decadal emission growth rates with line plot of global emission acceleration, (3) Heatmap of emission intensity by decade overlaid with contour lines showing emission concentration patterns.

Middle row: (4) Time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal (if applicable), and residual components of global emissions with scatter plot overlay of major historical events, (5) Multi-line chart of regional emission trajectories with ribbon plots showing uncertainty bands and annotated inflection points, (6) Slope chart showing emission ranking changes between 1950 and 2019 combined with connected scatter plot of emission velocity changes.

Bottom row: (7) Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots combined with lag scatter plots for emission time series analysis, (8) Cross-correlation heatmap between countries overlaid with network-style connection lines showing emission synchronization, (9) Calendar heatmap of annual emissions combined with time series plot showing long-term trends and cyclical patterns with moving average overlay.
