Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between customer financial characteristics and loan default risk. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot shows a scatter plot of customer income vs loan amount with points colored by current loan status and sized by interest rate, and the right plot displays a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between numerical variables (customer_age, customer_income, employment_duration, loan_int_rate, term_years, cred_hist_length) with annotations showing correlation coefficients.
