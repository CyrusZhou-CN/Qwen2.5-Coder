## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing loan default patterns across different customer segments. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Scatter plot with marginal histograms showing customer age vs income, colored by loan status with overlaid density contours, (2) Top-center: Grouped violin plots with box plots overlay comparing loan interest rates across loan grades, split by default status, (3) Top-right: Stacked bar chart with line plot overlay showing loan intent distribution and average loan amounts by home ownership status, (4) Middle-left: Radar chart comparing normalized mean values of numerical features (age, income, employment duration, loan amount, interest rate, term years, credit history length) between defaulted and non-defaulted loans, (5) Middle-center: Hierarchical clustering dendrogram with heatmap showing correlation patterns between customer demographics and loan characteristics, grouped by default status, (6) Middle-right: Parallel coordinates plot displaying multi-dimensional relationships between loan grade, term years, employment duration, and credit history length, with lines colored by default status, (7) Bottom-left: Network graph showing relationships between loan intent, home ownership, and loan grade nodes, with edge thickness representing default rates, (8) Bottom-center: Treemap with nested structure showing loan grade as primary partition and loan intent as secondary partition, sized by total loan amounts and colored by default rates, (9) Bottom-right: Cluster scatter plot using PCA dimensionality reduction on all numerical features, with points colored by loan status and shaped by loan grade, including cluster centroids and confidence ellipses.
