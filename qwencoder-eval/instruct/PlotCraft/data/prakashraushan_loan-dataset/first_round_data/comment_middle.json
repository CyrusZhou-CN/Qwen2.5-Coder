The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout:** Change the layout from the current 2x1 to the required 1x2 subplot structure, placing the two charts side-by-side.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Scatter Plot:**\n    *   Replace the pie chart with a scatter plot.\n    *   Set the x-axis to 'Customer Income' and the y-axis to 'Loan Amount'.\n    *   Color the data points based on 'Current Loan Status' and include a legend to explain the colors.\n    *   Size the data points based on 'Interest Rate' and add a size legend if possible.\n    *   Add a clear and relevant title, such as 'Customer Income vs. Loan Amount'.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Correlation Heatmap:**\n    *   Replace the bar chart with a correlation heatmap.\n    *   Use the specified variables: `customer_age`, `customer_income`, `employment_duration`, `loan_int_rate`, `term_years`, `cred_hist_length`.\n    *   Annotate each cell of the heatmap with the corresponding correlation coefficient, formatted to two decimal places.\n    *   Include a color bar to represent the correlation scale.\n    *   Add a clear title, such as 'Correlation Matrix of Financial Variables'.\n4.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Change the background color from black to white.\n    *   Replace the harsh neon color palette with a professional one. For the heatmap, use a diverging colormap (e.g., blue-white-red). For the scatter plot, use a set of distinct but visually pleasing colors.\n    *   Ensure all text (titles, axis labels, annotations) is correct, legible, and appropriately sized to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
