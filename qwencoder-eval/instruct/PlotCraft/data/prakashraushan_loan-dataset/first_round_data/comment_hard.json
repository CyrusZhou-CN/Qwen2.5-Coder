    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this dashboard, the following specific changes are recommended:\n1.  **Complete Missing/Incorrect Plots:**\n    -   **Subplot (0,1):** Generate the requested grouped violin plots with box plot overlays to show interest rates by loan grade and default status.\n    -   **Subplot (0,0):** Replace the hexbin plot with a standard scatter plot. Add marginal histograms to the top and right axes and overlay density contours on the main plot.\n    -   **Subplot (1,1):** Replace the heatmap with a clustermap to include the required hierarchical clustering dendrogram.\n    -   **Subplot (2,2):** Add the required confidence ellipses for the clusters.\n2.  **Correct Data Encodings:**\n    -   **Subplot (2,2):** Change the point coloring to represent 'loan status' as requested, while keeping the point shape to represent 'loan grade'.\n    -   **Subplot (2,1):** Recalculate the colors for the treemap to represent the 'default rate' for each category. Add a color bar to serve as a legend.\n    -   **Subplot (2,0):** Ensure the edge thickness in the network graph is mapped to 'default rates' as specified.\n3.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    -   Increase the vertical spacing between the main title ('Comprehensive Loan Default Analysis Dashboard') and the first row of subplots to eliminate the overlap with the title of subplot (0,1).\n    -   Use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `GridSpec` with adjusted `hspace` and `wspace`) to create even spacing and prevent labels from overlapping between plots.\n4.  **Aesthetics and Clarity:**\n    -   **Global:** Establish a consistent color palette. For example, use the same specific shade of blue for 'No Default' and red for 'Default' across all relevant subplots ((0,0), (1,0), (1,2)).\n    -   **Subplot (0,2):** Change the color of the 'Average Loan Amount' line plot to something less harsh (e.g., dark gray or navy blue) and reduce its line width and marker size for better visual balance.\n    -   **Subplot (1,0):** Add the text labels ('Default', 'No Default') to the legend.\n    -   **Subplot (0,2) & (1,1):** Improve readability of rotated x-axis labels by increasing plot width or using shorter abbreviations if necessary."
