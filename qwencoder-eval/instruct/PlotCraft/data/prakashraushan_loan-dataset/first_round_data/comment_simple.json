    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart fundamentally fails to meet the user's request. A complete regeneration is necessary. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the entire 2x1 layout with a single (1x1) histogram. The pie chart and scatter plot should be removed entirely. \n2. **Data Representation:** The histogram's x-axis should represent 'Customer Age', divided into appropriate bins to show the distribution. The y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or count of customers within each age bin. \n3. **Text and Labels:** \n   - The chart title must be 'Distribution of Customer Ages'.\n   - The x-axis must be labeled 'Customer Age'.\n   - The y-axis must be labeled 'Frequency'.\n4. **Formatting and Professionalism:** \n   - Use a professional, publication-ready style with a white background.\n   - The gridlines should be subtle (light gray and thin) to aid readability without distracting from the data bars.\n   - The title should have a slightly larger font size and/or be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n5. **Clarity:** Remove the obstructive red text box. No chart elements should overlap."
