To fulfill the request, a chart must be created from scratch with the following specifications:\n1.  **Generate the Chart:** Create a 1x1 line chart as requested.\n2.  **Plot Data:** Plot the time-series data for the total confirmed COVID-19 cases for the top 5 most affected states/UTs in India from April to August 2020.\n3.  **Axes:** The x-axis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should represent the total confirmed cases.\n4.  **Labels and Title:** Add a clear and descriptive title (e.g., 'Progression of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Top 5 Indian States'). Label the x-axis as 'Date' and the y-axis as 'Total Confirmed Cases'.\n5.  **Legend:** Include a legend to clearly distinguish the lines corresponding to each of the five states.\n6.  **Formatting:** Ensure the chart is well-formatted with legible text, appropriate tick marks, and a clean, professional appearance (e.g., white background, subtle gridlines)."
