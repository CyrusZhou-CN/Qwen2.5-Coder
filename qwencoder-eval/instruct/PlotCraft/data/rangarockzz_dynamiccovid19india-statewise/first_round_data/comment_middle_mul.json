    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the prompt's requirements. The following are instructions for a complete rebuild:\n\n1.  **Adherence to Prompt:** The primary issue is the complete disregard for the task instructions. The new chart must analyze COVID-19 data in India as specified.\n\n2.  **Layout and Formatting:**\n    *   Change the layout to the required 2x2 grid.\n    *   Adopt a professional aesthetic: use a white background, remove the black background and thick yellow borders.\n    *   Use subtle, light-gray gridlines for reference without distracting from the data.\n    *   Ensure adequate spacing between subplots to avoid a cramped appearance.\n\n3.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   Replace the jarring neon palette with a professional, harmonious color scheme. Use distinct, muted colors to represent different states consistently across all subplots. For example, assign blue to Maharashtra, orange to Kerala, etc.\n\n4.  **Text and Titles:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Set a clear, descriptive main title like 'Temporal Analysis of COVID-19 in India's Most Affected States'. Make it bold and larger than other text elements.\n    *   **Subplot Titles:** Provide a specific, informative title for each of the four subplots that describes its content (e.g., 'Subplot (0, 0): Total Confirmed Cases and Daily New Cases').\n    *   **Axis Labels:** All axes must be clearly and accurately labeled (e.g., 'Date', 'Number of Cases', 'Case Fatality Rate (%)').\n    *   **Legends:** Add a clear legend to each subplot to identify the states or data series being displayed.\n\n5.  **Chart Implementation (per subplot):**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create the composite chart as requested: a line chart with area fill for total cases of the top 5 states, and a secondary y-axis with a bar chart for daily new cases of the single most affected state.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create the stacked area chart for Active, Recovered, and Death cases for the top 3 states. Overlay line plots showing the recovery rate for each of these states. Ensure the lines are clearly visible over the stacked areas.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Create the multi-line chart for the case fatality rate of the top 5 states. Overlay a scatter plot showing the relationship between total cases and death rate at specified intervals.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create the dual-axis chart with a line plot for active cases (top 3 states) and a bar chart for the weekly growth rate, including error bars as specified."
