    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete and requires a complete regeneration. The primary issue is the failure to plot any data.\n1.  **Data Plotting**: The most critical step is to plot the time series data. Create five distinct lines on the chart, one for each of the top 5 most affected states/UTs in India.\n2.  **Axis Formatting**: The axes must be corrected. The x-axis should display dates (e.g., 'Jan-20', 'Feb-20') instead of the current '0.0' to '1.0' scale. The y-axis scale must be adjusted to reflect the actual number of confirmed cases (e.g., 0, 1M, 2M, etc.) instead of '0' to '1'.\n3.  **Legend**: The legend, currently an empty box in the top-left, must be populated. It should clearly map each colored line to the name of the state it represents.\n4.  **Color Scheme**: Assign a unique and visually distinct color to each of the five lines to ensure they can be easily differentiated."
