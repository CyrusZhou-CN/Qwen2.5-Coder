    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards. \n\n**Global Changes:**\n1.  **Fix the Title:** Replace the jumbled, overlapping text at the top with a single, coherent main title for the entire figure, such as 'Comprehensive COVID-19 Temporal Analysis in India (April-August 2020)'.\n2.  **Layout Spacing:** Reduce the excessive vertical whitespace between the rows of subplots to create a more compact and visually balanced grid.\n\n**Subplot-Specific Improvements:**\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0):** The stacked bar chart is incorrect for this purpose as it implies accumulation. Replace it with a grouped bar chart, where each time point has five distinct bars representing the daily new cases for each of the top 5 states.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Fulfill the prompt by adding the missing trend lines for the 'Recovered' and 'Deaths' components. Use different line styles (e.g., dashed for recovered, dotted for deaths) to distinguish them clearly from the 'Active' trend line.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0):** This plot must be completely remade as a slope chart. The x-axis should only have two categorical points: 'April 2020' and 'July 2020'. For each region, draw a single straight line connecting its case fatality rate value from April to July to clearly visualize the magnitude and direction of change.\n4.  **Subplot (2, 0):** Re-implement this visualization as a proper calendar heatmap. The layout should resemble a calendar grid (e.g., days of the week as columns, weeks as rows) for each month. Each cell should be colored based on the daily growth rate. The current scatter plot format fails to meet the prompt's requirement.\n5.  **Subplot (2, 1):** The prompt requires a decomposition into separate, aligned subplots. Recreate this panel with three vertically stacked subplots sharing the same x-axis. The top plot should show the 'Trend', the middle should show the 'Seasonal' component, and the bottom plot must show the 'Residual' component, which is currently missing entirely."
