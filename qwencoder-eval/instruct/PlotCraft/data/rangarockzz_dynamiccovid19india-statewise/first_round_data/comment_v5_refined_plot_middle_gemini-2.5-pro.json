    "improvement_suggestions": "To align with the prompt and improve quality, the entire chart needs to be restructured into a proper 2x2 grid.\n\n1.  **Layout Refinements:** Rebuild the figure as a strict 2x2 grid using `plt.subplots(2, 2)`. Ensure uniform spacing and sizing for all four main subplots. Eliminate the large vertical gap between the current rows.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:** To make the 'cumulative deaths' area chart visible, convert this to a dual-axis plot. Use the left y-axis for 'Confirmed Cases' (line chart) and a new right y-axis for 'Cumulative Deaths' (area chart). This will allow both datasets to be scaled and viewed clearly.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** Instead of incorrectly combining all states, use small multiples *within* this subplot's axes to show the stacked area chart 'for each state'. Create a 2x3 grid of mini-charts inside this quadrant, each with its own title for the state. This fulfills the requirement while maintaining readability.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:** Combine the five separate charts into the single multi-line chart requested. Plot all five states' growth rates on the same axes, using the established color code for differentiation. Apply transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.2`) to the error bands to ensure that overlapping regions remain distinguishable.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** Similar to subplot (0,1), the best way to fulfill the 'single plot' requirement without creating a cluttered mess is to use small multiples. Create a 2x3 grid of dual-axis bar/line charts within this quadrant, one for each state. This respects the 2x2 layout while presenting the complex data clearly.\n\n6.  **Text and Formatting Improvements:**\n    *   Make all four main subplot titles bold and increase their font size slightly to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Remove the word '(Sample)' from all titles for a more professional presentation.\n    *   Add the required annotations using `ax.annotate()` to point out key events, such as the start of a lockdown or a peak in cases, on the relevant charts.\n    *   Standardize axis labels. For example, ensure the y-axis label in subplot (0,0) reads 'Number of Cases (Millions)' instead of '1e6'."
