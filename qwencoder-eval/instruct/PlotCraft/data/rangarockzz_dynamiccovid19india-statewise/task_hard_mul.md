# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of COVID-19 in India across different states and metrics. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

1. Top-left: Create a dual-axis time series plot showing the evolution of total confirmed cases (line chart) overlaid with daily new cases (bar chart) for the top 5 most affected states, with a secondary y-axis for the bar chart to handle scale differences.

2. Top-right: Design a stacked area chart showing the composition of cases (Active, Recovered, Deaths) over time for Maharashtra, with trend lines overlaid for each component to highlight the changing proportions.

3. Middle-left: Construct a slope chart with error bars showing the change in case fatality rates (Deaths/Total Cases ratio) between April and July 2020 for all states, with states grouped by geographic regions using different colors.

4. Middle-right: Build a multi-line time series with confidence bands showing the recovery rate trends (Recovered/Total Cases ratio) for different state categories (high-population vs low-population states), including moving averages and uncertainty bands.

5. Bottom-left: Create a calendar heatmap overlaid with trend arrows showing the daily growth rate of active cases across different months, with color intensity representing growth magnitude and arrows indicating direction of change.

6. Bottom-right: Design a time series decomposition plot showing the trend, seasonal, and residual components of new daily cases for India as a whole, with each component displayed as separate but aligned subplots within this panel.

Use data from at least 15 different date files to capture the temporal progression, and ensure each visualization reveals different aspects of how the pandemic evolved across Indian states over time.
