    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revisions to meet the task requirements and achieve a professional quality. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Global Layout:** Apply a layout adjustment function like `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)` at the end of the script. This will automatically resize subplots and adjust spacing to prevent titles and labels from overlapping, which is a major issue across the grid.\n\n2.  **Data Correction (Critical):**\n    *   **Subplots (1, 0) and (1, 1):** The longitude axis is incorrectly scaled (showing values like `1.2e9`). This is the most critical error and must be fixed. Ensure the longitude data is in the correct decimal degrees format (e.g., 126.xx to 127.xx) before plotting. These two plots are currently invalid.\n\n3.  **Fulfill Missing Requirements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** After fixing the coordinates, ensure the `density contours` are generated and visible. They are currently missing entirely.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Re-implement this chart to include the required `marginal histograms` for both latitude and longitude distributions. A function like `seaborn.jointplot` with `kind='hist'` is well-suited for this.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** The prompt asked for `camera coordinate distributions` (plural). This plot only shows latitude. Add a corresponding box/swarm plot for the longitude distribution, or combine them into a single 2D plot.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** The plot is missing the `scatter plots in the lower triangle`. This can be achieved using `seaborn.PairGrid` and mapping a heatmap to the upper triangle and scatter plots to the lower triangle.\n\n4.  **Text and Label Adjustments:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** The bubble labels overlap. Use a library like `adjustText` to automatically repel labels and prevent them from colliding.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2):** The title says 'Top 5 Districts' but there are six districts plotted. Correct the title to 'Top 6 Districts' or filter the data to show only five. Investigate the anomalous plot for 'Jung-gu', which appears as a single line.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** Adjust the left margin of the subplot (`plt.subplots_adjust(left=...)`) to make the full y-axis labels ('population', 'area', etc.) visible. Remove the extraneous '-' from the x-axis tick labels.\n\n5.  **Layout Refinements:**\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between rows of subplots to give titles more room and prevent them from crowding the plot above. You can use `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=...)` for manual control."
