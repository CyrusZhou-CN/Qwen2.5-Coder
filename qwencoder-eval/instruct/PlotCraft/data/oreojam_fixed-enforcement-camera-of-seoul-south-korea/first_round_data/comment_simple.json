    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the incorrect chart type. The prompt asked for a histogram, not a bar chart.\n\n1.  **Correct the Chart Type to a Histogram:**\n    *   The data for the histogram should be the list of camera counts per district (the values currently shown on the y-axis).\n    *   The x-axis of the new histogram should represent bins for the 'Number of Cameras' (e.g., 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, etc.).\n    *   The y-axis should be relabeled to 'Frequency' or 'Number of Districts' and should show how many districts fall into each camera count bin.\n\n2.  **Update Text Elements for the Correct Histogram:**\n    *   **Title:** Change the title to something more specific for a histogram, such as 'Frequency Distribution of Camera Counts Across Seoul Districts'.\n    *   **X-axis Label:** Change to 'Number of Cameras'.\n    *   **Y-axis Label:** Change to 'Number of Districts (Frequency)'.\n\n3.  **Alternative Suggestion (If a Bar Chart is Desired):**\n    *   If the goal was to rank districts by camera count (as the current chart does), it would be much more readable as a **horizontal bar chart**. This would allow the district names to be displayed horizontally, eliminating the need for rotated text and improving legibility.\n\n4.  **Formatting Improvements:**\n    *   Make the chart title bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy and give it a more professional appearance."
