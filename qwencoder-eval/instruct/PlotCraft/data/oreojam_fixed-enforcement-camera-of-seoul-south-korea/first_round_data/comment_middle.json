    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1.  **Layout**: Change the layout from 2x1 to the specified 1x2 (one row, two columns). Add a main title for the entire figure, such as 'Parking Enforcement Camera Deployment in Seoul'.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Scatter Plot**: \n    *   **Data & Axes**: Plot the actual longitude (x-axis) and latitude (y-axis) of the cameras. Label the axes correctly.\n    *   **Encoding**: Color the points based on their district and size them based on camera density. \n    *   **Legend**: Add a clear legend explaining the color-to-district mapping and another legend for the point sizes.\n    *   **Title**: Set the title to 'Spatial Distribution of Parking Cameras in Seoul'.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Grouped Bar Chart**:\n    *   **Orientation & Axes**: This should be a vertical bar chart. The x-axis should list the 'Districts', and the y-axis should represent the 'Value'. Rotate the x-axis labels (district names) to 45 degrees for better readability if they overlap.\n    *   **Data Scaling**: The 'Population' and 'Cameras' data have vastly different scales, making the 'Population' bars invisible. Use a secondary y-axis for one of the variables or normalize the data to make a meaningful visual comparison.\n    *   **Title**: Set the title to 'Camera Count vs. Population Density by District'.\n4.  **General Aesthetics**: \n    *   **Formatting**: Switch to a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   **Color**: Use a single, consistent color palette to represent the districts across both subplots. Ensure the colors are distinct and visually appealing.\n    *   **Text**: Replace all nonsensical text ('Banana', 'Quantum Flux', 'Glarbnok') with accurate and descriptive titles and labels relevant to the task."
