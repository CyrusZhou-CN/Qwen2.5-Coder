## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the spatial clustering and distribution patterns of Seoul's parking enforcement cameras. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a scatter plot of camera locations (latitude vs longitude) with points colored by district and sized by the density of cameras in each area, and the right plot shows a grouped bar chart comparing the number of cameras per district alongside each district's population density (population/area). Add appropriate legends, titles, and ensure the district colors are consistent across both plots to reveal how camera deployment relates to district characteristics and spatial clustering patterns.
