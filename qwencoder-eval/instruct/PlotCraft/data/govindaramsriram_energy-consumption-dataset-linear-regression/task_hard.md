# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing energy consumption patterns across different building characteristics. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Create a scatter plot with best-fit line showing the relationship between Square Footage and Energy Consumption, with points colored by Building Type and sized by Number of Occupants. Add marginal histograms on both axes.

Top-right: Generate a correlation heatmap overlaid with a bubble plot showing correlations between all numerical variables (Square Footage, Number of Occupants, Appliances Used, Average Temperature, Energy Consumption), where bubble sizes represent the absolute correlation strength.

Bottom-left: Construct a violin plot combined with strip plot showing Energy Consumption distribution across Building Types, with separate violins for Weekday vs Weekend, and overlay individual data points as a jitter plot.

Bottom-right: Design a parallel coordinates plot combined with a density contour overlay showing the multivariate relationships between Square Footage, Number of Occupants, Appliances Used, and Energy Consumption, with lines colored by Building Type and transparency indicating density regions.
