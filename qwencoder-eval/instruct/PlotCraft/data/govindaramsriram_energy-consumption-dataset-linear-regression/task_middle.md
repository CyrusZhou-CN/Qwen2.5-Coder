## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization that combines a scatter plot matrix with correlation heatmap overlay. Use the combined training and test energy consumption datasets to: 1) Generate a 3x3 subplot grid where the upper triangle shows scatter plots between all numerical variables (Square Footage, Number of Occupants, Appliances Used, Average Temperature, Energy Consumption), 2) Display correlation coefficients as text annotations on each scatter plot, 3) Use different colors/markers to distinguish between Building Types across all scatter plots, 4) Include trend lines for each Building Type in the scatter plots, and 5) Add a correlation heatmap as the center diagonal element showing the correlation matrix for all numerical variables with annotated correlation values.
