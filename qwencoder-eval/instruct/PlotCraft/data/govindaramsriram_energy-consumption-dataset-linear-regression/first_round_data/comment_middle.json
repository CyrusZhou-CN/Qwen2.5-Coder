    "improvement_suggestions": "To meet the task requirements and improve quality, the chart needs a complete redesign. \n1. **Task Compliance & Layout:** Re-implement the visualization as a proper 5x5 grid to accommodate all 5 specified numerical variables, as a 3x3 grid is insufficient. Populate the upper triangle with scatter plots, place histograms or density plots of each variable on the diagonal, and leave the lower triangle empty or fill it with correlation values. The single heatmap should be removed in favor of this more standard 'pair plot' structure, which better fulfills the spirit of the request. If a single heatmap is mandatory, it should be a separate, well-formatted plot.\n2. **Clarity & Overlap:**\n   - Reduce the main title's font size significantly (e.g., to 16pt) and center it above the entire grid with proper padding to eliminate overlap.\n   - In the scatter plots, reduce the marker size and apply transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.6`) to mitigate the severe overplotting and make underlying patterns more visible.\n   - The trend lines are not useful as the correlations are near zero. Remove them to de-clutter the plots. If they must be kept, make them much thinner (e.g., `linewidth=1`).\n   - Move the legend to a single location outside the plot grid, for instance, to the top right of the entire figure, to avoid obscuring any data.\n3. **Layout & Spacing:** Use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust subplot spacing to create a compact, balanced, and professional grid with minimal wasted white space.\n4. **Formatting & Professionalism:**\n   - Set the figure background to white (`facecolor='white'`).\n   - Change the gridlines to be subtle: light gray, thin, and dashed (e.g., `color='lightgray', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5`).\n   - For a scatter plot matrix, show axis labels only on the outer plots (y-labels on the far-left column, x-labels on the bottom row) to reduce redundancy and visual noise."
