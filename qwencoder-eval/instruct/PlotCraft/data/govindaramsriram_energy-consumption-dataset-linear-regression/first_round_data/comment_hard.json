    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to fulfill the missing requirement in the task prompt: add marginal histograms to the top and right axes of the scatter plot in subplot (0, 0) to show the distributions of 'Square Footage' and 'Energy Consumption'. For minor aesthetic enhancements: in subplot (0, 1), consider shortening the rotated x-axis tick labels (e.g., 'Square Footage' to 'Sq. Footage', 'Number of Occupants' to 'Occupants') to reduce visual clutter. In the parallel coordinates plot (subplot (1, 1)), the lines are very dense; slightly increasing their transparency (alpha value) could make the underlying density contour overlay more prominent."
