    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to meet the task requirements and should be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Discard Current Charts:** Remove the pie chart and the two bar charts entirely.\n2. **Create the Correct Chart Type:** Generate a single scatter plot.\n3. **Map Data to Axes:** Set the x-axis to represent 'Square Footage' and the y-axis to represent 'Energy Consumption'.\n4. **Implement Color-Coding:** Color each point on the scatter plot according to its 'Building Type'.\n5. **Add a Legend:** Include a legend to clearly explain which color corresponds to which 'Building Type'.\n6. **Add Best-Fit Line:** Overlay a linear regression (best-fit) line on the scatter plot to show the overall trend.\n7. **Correct All Text:** \n   - Change the main title to something descriptive and relevant, such as 'Relationship between Square Footage and Energy Consumption'.\n   - Ensure the x-axis is labeled 'Square Footage' and the y-axis is labeled 'Energy Consumption'.\n8. **Improve Color Palette:** Replace the current neon colors with a professional, more subdued color palette. Use distinct but harmonious colors for the different building types to ensure clarity.\n9. **Professional Formatting:** Use a white background for the chart area. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle. Ensure the title is bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
