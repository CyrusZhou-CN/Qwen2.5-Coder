    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally flawed and requires a complete recreation from scratch. The current version is unsalvageable.\n\n1.  **Start Over with a Single Plot:** Discard the current two-plot layout. Create a new chart with a single subplot (a 1x1 layout).\n2.  **Use the Correct Chart Type:** Generate a standard histogram where the x-axis represents the prize value and the y-axis represents the frequency (count) of winners for each prize value bin.\n3.  **Correct All Text Elements:**\n    *   **Title:** Replace 'Banana Distribution of Unicorns' with a descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Premium Bond Prize Values'.\n    *   **Y-Axis Label:** Replace 'Money' and 'Prize in GBP' with a single label: 'Number of Winners' or 'Frequency'.\n    *   **X-Axis Label:** Replace 'Winners' with 'Prize Value (£)'.\n4.  **Remove All Extraneous Elements:** Delete the top green bar, the nonsensical legend ('Glarbnok's Revenge', 'More Bananas'), the 'WOW!' text annotation, and the second y-axis.\n5.  **Adopt a Professional Aesthetic:**\n    *   **Color Scheme:** Use a single, muted color (e.g., a standard blue or gray) for the histogram bars. Avoid all neon colors.\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a clean white background. If gridlines are necessary, make them thin and light gray so they do not distract from the data.\n    *   **Formatting:** Ensure the title is bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
