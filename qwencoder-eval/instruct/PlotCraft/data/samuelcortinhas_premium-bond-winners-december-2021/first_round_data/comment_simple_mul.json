    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical issue is the complete absence of data in the plot. The data processing and plotting steps must be fixed to generate the histogram.\n\n1.  **Data Plotting:** The data processing pipeline needs to be debugged to ensure prize values are correctly cleaned, standardized, and counted. The annotation 'Total standard tier prizes analyzed: 0' indicates that no data was successfully processed. This must be resolved so that the histogram bars can be rendered.\n2.  **Y-Axis Correction:** The y-axis is fundamentally incorrect. The label 'Frequency (Number of Prizes)' requires an integer-based scale starting from 0. The current decimal scale, which includes negative values, is inappropriate for frequency counts. The y-axis range and ticks must be updated to reflect the actual number of prizes in each bin.\n3.  **Remove Debug Annotation:** The text 'Total standard tier prizes analyzed: 0' is likely a debugging artifact. It should be removed from the final chart for a cleaner presentation, unless its inclusion is a specific requirement."
