## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of premium bond winners across 2021-2022. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Monthly total prize value distribution with overlaid trend line and confidence intervals, (2) Prize value composition over time showing stacked areas for different prize tiers with percentage annotations, (3) Geographic concentration changes with dual-axis showing winner count bars and diversity index line.

Middle row: (4) Investment behavior evolution combining violin plots of holding values by month with overlaid box plots and median trend line, (5) Purchase timing patterns showing heatmap of purchase dates vs win dates with correlation coefficient annotations, (6) Bond value vs total holding relationship over time using animated-style scatter plots with size-coded bubbles and temporal color gradient.

Bottom row: (7) Regional performance matrix combining clustered bar charts of win rates by area with overlaid line plots showing investment efficiency ratios, (8) Seasonal decomposition showing original monthly data, trend, seasonal components, and residuals in a single composite plot, (9) Winner profile evolution dashboard combining multiple small multiples: histogram of days between purchase and win, pie chart of prize distribution, and time series of average holding values with prediction intervals.
