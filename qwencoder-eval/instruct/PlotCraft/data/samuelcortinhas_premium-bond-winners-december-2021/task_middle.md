## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal evolution of premium bond prize distributions across 2022. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart tracking the total monthly prize value awarded over time, and the bottom plot shows a stacked area chart revealing how the composition of different prize tiers (£1,000,000, £100,000, £50,000, £25,000, £10,000, £5,000, £1,000) changes month by month throughout 2022. Include proper formatting for currency values and ensure both plots share the same x-axis timeline for easy comparison of prize value trends versus prize tier distribution patterns.
