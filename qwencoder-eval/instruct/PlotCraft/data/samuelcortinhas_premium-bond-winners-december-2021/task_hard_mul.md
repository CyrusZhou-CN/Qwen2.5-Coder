## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Premium Bond winners across different dimensions. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots):
1. Monthly prize distribution evolution: Create a stacked area chart showing the count of different prize tiers (£1M, £100K, £50K, £25K, £10K, £5K, £1K) over time, overlaid with a line plot showing the total monthly prize value
2. Geographic concentration trends: Plot a line chart showing the number of unique areas (regions) winning prizes each month, combined with a bar chart showing the monthly average total holding value per winner
3. Investment behavior patterns: Display a scatter plot of average bond purchase date (converted to years since purchase) vs. month, with bubble sizes representing average total holdings, overlaid with a trend line

Bottom row (2 subplots):
4. Seasonal winning patterns: Create a polar/radar chart showing prize frequency by month combined with a circular bar chart showing average prize values, demonstrating cyclical patterns in the data
5. Winner profile evolution: Plot multiple overlapping line charts showing the monthly trends of: average total holdings, average individual bond values, and the ratio of total holdings to individual bond values, with different colors and a secondary y-axis

Use data from at least 8 different monthly files to ensure robust temporal analysis. Include proper legends, titles, and annotations highlighting key temporal shifts in Premium Bond winner characteristics.
