## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of prize values across all months in the dataset. Clean and standardize the prize value formats from different CSV files, convert them to numerical values, and display the frequency of different prize amounts (£1,000, £5,000, £10,000, £25,000, £50,000, £100,000, £1,000,000) using appropriate bins. Include proper axis labels and a title that indicates this represents prize distributions across the entire year of data.
