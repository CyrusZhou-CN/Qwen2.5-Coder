## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal evolution of premium bond winners across 2022. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot combines a line chart showing the monthly count of £1,000,000 winners overlaid with a bar chart displaying the total monthly prize value distribution across all prize tiers. The bottom plot should show a stacked area chart depicting the monthly composition of different prize value categories (£1,000,000, £100,000, £50,000, £25,000, £10,000, £5,000, £1,000) to reveal how the prize structure evolved throughout the year. Use different colors for each prize tier and ensure both plots share the same x-axis timeline from January to December 2022.
