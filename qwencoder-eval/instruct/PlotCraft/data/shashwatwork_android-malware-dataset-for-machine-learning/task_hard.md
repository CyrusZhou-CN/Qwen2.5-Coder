## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing Android malware detection patterns through feature clustering and classification insights. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top row (Feature Analysis): (1) Create a correlation heatmap overlaid with hierarchical clustering dendrogram showing relationships between top 20 most discriminative features, (2) Generate a parallel coordinates plot with density curves showing feature value patterns for malware vs benign apps across 8 selected high-variance features, (3) Build a radar chart with box plot overlays comparing feature distributions between malware and benign classes for 6 key permission categories.

Middle row (Permission Patterns): (4) Construct a network graph with node size proportional to feature importance, showing connections between related Android permissions and API calls, overlaid with community detection clusters, (5) Design a treemap with nested bar charts showing hierarchical grouping of permissions by category (SMS, Location, Network, etc.) with malware prevalence indicators, (6) Create a bubble plot with trend lines showing the relationship between permission count, API call frequency, and malware probability.

Bottom row (Classification Insights): (7) Generate a scatter plot matrix with marginal histograms showing pairwise relationships between top 4 most predictive features, colored by class and overlaid with decision boundaries, (8) Build a stacked area chart with violin plot overlays showing feature value distributions across different malware families or benign app categories, (9) Construct a cluster heatmap with dendrogram showing hierarchical clustering of apps based on their feature profiles, with annotation bars indicating true class labels and prediction confidence scores.
