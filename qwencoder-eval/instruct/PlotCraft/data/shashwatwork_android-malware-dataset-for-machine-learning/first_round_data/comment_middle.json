    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Chart Implementation:** The primary issue is the failure to generate three of the four requested charts. The code must be fixed to produce the correct plots:\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the bar chart with the specified violin plot comparing feature activation between malware and benign apps.\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** Generate the requested box plot for the top 10 most activated features. The data used for the bar chart in (0,1) should be used here, but visualized as a box plot.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** Generate the requested stacked histogram for high-risk features.\n2. **Resolve Data Errors:** Address the underlying data issue that leads to the 'Insufficient data' messages in the bottom two subplots.\n3. **Improve Text Readability:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1) (Bar Chart):** The x-axis tick labels are unreadable due to length and overlap. Rotate the labels to 90 degrees or, preferably, switch to a horizontal bar chart (`barplot(y=features, x=counts)`) to give the labels adequate space.\n4. **Correct Titles and Labels:** Ensure all titles and axis labels accurately reflect the content of their respective subplots as defined in the prompt. For example, the title 'Feature Activation: Malware vs Benign Apps' should be on subplot (0,1), not (1,0).\n5. **Layout Refinement:** Once all plots are generated, adjust the `tight_layout` or `subplots_adjust` parameters to ensure there is no overlap between titles, axis labels, and plot areas, creating a balanced and professional final grid."
