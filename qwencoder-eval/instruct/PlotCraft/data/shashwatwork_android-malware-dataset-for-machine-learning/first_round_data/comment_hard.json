    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n1.  **Adhere to the Prompt:** The primary issue is the complete disregard for the instructions. The new chart must be built by strictly following every detail of the original task.\n2.  **Correct Layout:** Implement the required 3x3 subplot grid.\n3.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** Generate the specific, complex chart type requested for each of the nine subplot positions. For example:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create the correlation heatmap with a hierarchical clustering dendrogram.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create the parallel coordinates plot with density curves.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2):** Create the radar chart with box plot overlays.\n    *   ...and so on for all nine specified plots.\n4.  **Use Relevant Data and Theme:** All visualizations must be centered on the 'Android Malware Detection' theme. All titles, axis labels, and legends must be accurate and relevant to this topic. Remove all nonsensical text.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a standard white background for a clean, professional appearance.\n    *   Select a harmonious and visually appealing color palette. Avoid using clashing, high-saturation neon colors.\n    *   Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Remove all large, distracting text overlays.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy using appropriate font sizes and weights for titles and labels."
