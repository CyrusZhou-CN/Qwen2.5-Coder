    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the missing data. The chart must be corrected to include a bar representing the count of 'Malware' applications. Additionally, several visual improvements are needed:\n1.  **Data Representation:** Ensure the chart accurately displays two bars: one for the 'Malware' count and one for the 'Benign' count.\n2.  **Color Scheme:** Replace the harsh neon green. Use a professional, two-color palette to clearly distinguish the categories. For example, use a muted red for 'Malware' and a muted blue for 'Benign' to create clear visual contrast.\n3.  **Text Formatting:** Make the title 'Distribution of Malware vs Benign Applications' bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy and distinguish it from the axis labels.\n4.  **Data Labels:** Add data labels (text showing the exact count) on top of each bar. This will make the precise values immediately clear to the viewer without them having to refer to the y-axis.\n5.  **Layout Refinement:** Once both bars are included, ensure there is adequate spacing between them to prevent the chart from looking cramped."
