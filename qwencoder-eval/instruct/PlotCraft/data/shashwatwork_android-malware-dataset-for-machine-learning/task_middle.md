Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive distribution analysis of Android malware detection features using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left subplot, display a histogram with overlaid KDE curve showing the distribution of the number of active features per application (sum of binary features across all columns except 'class'). In the top-right subplot, create a violin plot comparing the feature activation distributions between malware (class='M') and benign (class='S') applications. In the bottom-left subplot, generate a box plot showing the distribution of the top 10 most frequently activated permissions/API calls. In the bottom-right subplot, create a stacked histogram comparing the frequency distribution of specific high-risk features (SEND_SMS, READ_PHONE_STATE, INTERNET, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) between malware and benign apps.
