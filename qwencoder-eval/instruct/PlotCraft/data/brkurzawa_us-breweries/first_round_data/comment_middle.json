    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign to meet the prompt's requirements and achieve basic readability.\n1. **Layout Correction:** Re-implement the visualization using a proper 1x2 subplot grid. The pie chart should be in the left subplot (0, 0) and the horizontal bar chart in the right subplot (0, 1). Use `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust spacing to prevent overlap between the two plots.\n2. **Titles and Labels:**\n   - Change the main title to something descriptive, like 'Composition of Brewery Types in California'.\n   - Add specific titles to each subplot: 'Distribution by Percentage' for the pie chart (0, 0) and 'Count by Type' for the bar chart (0, 1).\n   - Correct the bar chart's axis labels. The y-axis label should be 'Brewery Type' and the x-axis label should be 'Number of Breweries'.\n3. **Data Labeling:**\n   - On the bar chart (0, 1), the labels on the bars must be changed from incorrect percentages to the actual counts of breweries as requested in the prompt.\n   - On the pie chart (0, 0), improve the readability of percentage labels. For smaller slices, consider using leader lines to place labels outside the pie to prevent them from overlapping.\n4. **Color Scheme:** Replace the current garish neon color palette with a professional, qualitative color palette (e.g., 'Tableau10', 'Paired', or a ColorBrewer set). The same color should represent the same brewery type in both plots.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Set the figure background to white.\n   - If using gridlines on the bar chart, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines).\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the subplot titles.\n   - For better readability, sort the bars in the horizontal bar chart (0, 1) in descending or ascending order of count."
