    "improvement_suggestions": "To significantly improve this chart, the primary focus should be on resolving the label clutter. \n1. **Consolidate Small Slices**: Group the brewery types with small percentages (e.g., under 2%) into a single 'Other' category. This will drastically simplify the chart and make it more readable. \n2. **Eliminate Label Overlap**: Remove the direct text labels from the pie slices, especially the small ones. Rely on the legend to identify each category. The percentages can either be kept on the slices (if they fit) or moved into the legend (e.g., 'Brewpub (64.1%)').\n3. **Refine 'Explode' Effect**: The 'explode' effect should be used sparingly to highlight a single, important slice, not all of them. Remove the explosion from all slices for a cleaner, more professional look. \n4. **Improve Legend and Colors**: Move the legend to a position where it doesn't risk overlapping with chart elements. Revise the color palette to ensure every color is clearly distinct; specifically, change one of the teal colors and one of the magenta colors to something different.\n5. **Consider an Alternative Chart Type**: A pie chart is not ideal for displaying this many categories with such a skewed distribution. A horizontal bar chart, sorted from largest to smallest, would be a much clearer and more effective way to present this data, as it would eliminate all overlap issues and allow for easy comparison between all categories."
