Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of brewery types in California. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of different brewery types, and the right plot shows a horizontal bar chart displaying the count of breweries for each type. Both plots should use the same color scheme and include proper titles, labels, and legends. Add percentage labels to the pie chart and count labels to the bar chart for clarity.
