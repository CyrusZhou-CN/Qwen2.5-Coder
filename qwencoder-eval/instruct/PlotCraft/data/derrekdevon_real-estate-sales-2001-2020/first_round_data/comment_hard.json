    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary need is to address the failures in task compliance by correctly implementing the specified chart types and overlays.\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Add the required error bars to the 'Avg Assessed Value' line chart to show the standard deviation.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1):** The vertical lines representing 'Transaction Count' are too thin. Replace them with standard bars (`plt.bar` with a defined width) to improve visibility.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Overlay the required line plots on the stacked area chart. For each property type, a separate line should track its average sale amount over time. This will likely require adding a secondary y-axis on the right to accommodate the different data scales (count vs. price).\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1):** This subplot needs a complete rework. First, overlay violin plots on the existing box plots. Second, the data should be grouped by quarter as requested, not just by property type. Third, the 'Nan' category should be removed through data cleaning.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 2):** This visualization is incorrect. It should be a proper heatmap showing the correlation between assessed value and sale amount, likely with months on one axis and another variable on the other. After creating a valid heatmap, overlay the required scatter points to differentiate between residential and commercial properties.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 0):** Complete the time series decomposition by adding the 'Seasonal' and 'Residual' components as separate line charts, in addition to the existing 'Original' and 'Trend' lines.\n7.  **Subplot (2, 1):** Correct the axes to match the prompt. The x-axis should represent months over time, not just years. The y-axis must be changed from 'Avg Years Until Sold' to 'Average Days Until Sold', and the underlying data must be corrected to be plausible (i.e., non-negative values in days).\n8.  **Subplot (2, 2):** The lines representing the top 5 towns are clustered at the bottom and are difficult to distinguish. Consider using a log scale for the y-axis ('Monthly Transactions') to better visualize the trends of the smaller towns relative to the total market, or plot the total market on a secondary y-axis."
