    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Chart Type and Data in Subplot (0, 0):**\n   - Change the chart from a standard horizontal bar chart to a proper diverging bar chart. Bars should extend left for negative deviations (sale < assessed) and right for positive deviations (sale > assessed) from a central y-axis at x=0.\n   - Recalculate the x-axis data to be the actual percentage difference: `((Sale Amount - Assessed Value) / Assessed Value) * 100`. The current data and label are mismatched.\n\n2. **Address Data Scaling Issues:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** The current plot is unreadable due to an extreme outlier. To fix this, cap the x-axis at a reasonable range (e.g., -100% to 100%) to allow for the visualization of the majority of the data. The existence of values beyond this range can be mentioned in a caption or indicated with arrows on the bars.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** The box plots are compressed due to outliers. Set a y-axis limit to 'zoom in' on the interquartile ranges, for example, `ylim=(0, 3.0)`. This will make the differences in distributions between property types much clearer.\n\n3. **Improve Text and Labels:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** The y-axis, labeled 'Properties', has no tick labels, making it impossible to identify any specific data point. While labeling all 100 is impractical, consider removing the axis ticks and labels entirely for a cleaner look, as the purpose is to show the distribution of deviations, not identify individual properties.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** To prevent the minor overlap in the x-axis labels, either increase the overall figure width or slightly reduce the font size of the tick labels.\n\n4. **Enhance Visual Elements:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** The black color for the box plot whiskers, fliers, medians, and caps is very heavy. Consider using a more subtle gray (e.g., '#333333') to make the colored boxes stand out more and reduce visual clutter."
