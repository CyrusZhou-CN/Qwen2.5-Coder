    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the handling of the data's scale, likely due to extreme outliers. To fix this, the following steps are crucial:\n1. **Handle Outliers/Adjust Axis Limits**: The x-axis extends to 1.2 million, which is an unrealistic value for a 'Sales Ratio'. This is compressing the entire meaningful distribution into one bar. The data should be investigated for outliers. A simple fix would be to limit the x-axis to a reasonable range for this type of ratio, for example, from 0 to 2 or 0 to 5 (e.g., `plt.xlim(0, 2)`). This will reveal the shape of the distribution for the vast majority of the data points.\n2. **Re-evaluate Binning**: Once the x-axis is appropriately scaled, the requested 15 bins will become visible and will effectively show the data's distribution within that range.\n3. **Improve Formatting**: To enhance the professional appearance, make the title 'Distribution of Sales Ratio Values' bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy. Additionally, consider making the grid lines a lighter shade of gray to make them less distracting from the data."
