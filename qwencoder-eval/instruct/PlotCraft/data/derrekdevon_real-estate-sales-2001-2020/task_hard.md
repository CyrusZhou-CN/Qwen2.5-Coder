## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing real estate market dynamics over time. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Market Value Evolution
- Subplot 1: Line chart showing average assessed value trends over months with error bars indicating standard deviation, overlaid with a scatter plot of individual high-value transactions (>$500K)
- Subplot 2: Dual-axis plot combining a bar chart of monthly transaction volumes with a line chart showing the rolling 3-month average of sales ratios
- Subplot 3: Area chart displaying the cumulative distribution of sale amounts over time, with a secondary line showing the median sale price trend

Row 2: Property Type Dynamics
- Subplot 4: Stacked area chart showing the composition of property types sold each month, overlaid with line plots tracking the average sale amount for each property type
- Subplot 5: Box plots showing sales ratio distributions by property type for each quarter, with violin plots overlaid to show the density distribution
- Subplot 6: Heatmap showing the correlation between assessed value and sale amount across different months, with scatter points overlaid for residential vs commercial properties

Row 3: Geographic and Temporal Patterns
- Subplot 7: Time series decomposition plot showing seasonal patterns in sales volume, with trend and residual components displayed as separate line charts within the same subplot
- Subplot 8: Bubble chart where x-axis is months, y-axis is average days until sold, bubble size represents transaction volume, and bubble color represents average sales ratio
- Subplot 9: Multi-line chart showing the top 5 towns by transaction volume, with each line representing monthly sales trends, overlaid with a background area chart showing total market activity
