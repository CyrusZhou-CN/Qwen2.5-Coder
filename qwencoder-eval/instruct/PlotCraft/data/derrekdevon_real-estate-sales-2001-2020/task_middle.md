# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the deviation between assessed values and actual sale amounts across different property types. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a diverging bar chart displaying the percentage difference between sale amount and assessed value for each property in the dataset, colored by property type, and (2) a box plot showing the distribution of sales ratios grouped by property type. Sort the diverging bars by the magnitude of deviation to highlight properties that sold significantly above or below their assessed values.
