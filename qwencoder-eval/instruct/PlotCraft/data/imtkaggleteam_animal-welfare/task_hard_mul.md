# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the composition and structure of global animal welfare across different production systems. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (1,1): Create a stacked bar chart showing the composition of egg production systems in the UK over time, overlaid with line plots tracking the percentage change of each system from the base year.

Top row (1,2): Design a treemap showing the hierarchical composition of animal lives lost per kilogram (direct vs total impact) for different animal products, with bubble size representing meat yield per animal and color intensity showing the efficiency ratio.

Middle row (2,1): Construct a stacked area chart displaying the temporal composition of hen housing systems across multiple countries, combined with scatter points indicating the total number of laying hens for scale reference.

Middle row (2,2): Build a pie chart showing the global composition of farmed aquatic animals (fish vs crustaceans) with an inner donut chart breaking down the uncertainty ranges (lower bound, estimate, upper bound) for each category.

Bottom row (3,1): Create a horizontal stacked bar chart comparing the composition of cage-free vs caged egg production across different countries, overlaid with error bars showing the variance in housing system adoption.

Bottom row (3,2): Design a waterfall chart showing how direct animal lives lost transforms into total lives lost (including indirect deaths) across different animal products, with connecting flow lines illustrating the additional impact components.
