## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart that ranks different animal products by the number of animal lives lost per kilogram of product. Use the direct deaths data to show which animal products require the most animal lives per kilogram, and overlay this with the total deaths data (including indirect deaths) using a different color or pattern to highlight the difference between direct and total animal lives lost. Sort the products from highest to lowest total lives lost per kilogram.
