    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, focus on resolving the critical text overlap issues and enhancing clarity. \n1. **Subplot (0, 0) - Stacked Bar Chart:** Rotate the x-axis labels to prevent overlap. A 45-degree rotation with right alignment (`ha='right'`) or a 90-degree rotation would make the 'Animal Product' categories readable. \n2. **Subplot (1, 0) - Pie Chart:** This chart is not suitable for the data due to the large number of small categories. Replace it with a horizontal bar chart sorted from highest to lowest proportion. This would eliminate all label overlap and make comparisons much easier. If a pie chart must be used, remove the direct labels and the 'explode' effect. Instead, group all slices below 2% into an 'Other' category and use a legend positioned outside the plot to label the slices. \n3. **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the vertical space between the two subplots to improve separation (e.g., using `subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)`). \n4. **Text Formatting:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main titles for each subplot bold and slightly larger than the axis labels. \n5. **Color Scheme:** For the pie chart (or its replacement), select a more harmonious, qualitative color palette (e.g., 'Paired' or 'Pastel1' from Matplotlib) to improve the visual appeal."
