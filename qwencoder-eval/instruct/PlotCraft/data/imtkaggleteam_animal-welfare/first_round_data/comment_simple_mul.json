    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct the Sorting:** Reorder the bars to comply with the prompt. 'Shrimp', which has the highest total lives lost, should be at the top, and the other products should follow in descending order.\n2. **Simplify the Axes:** Remove the entire right-side y-axis, including its labels and title ('Lives per Kilogram (Total)'). It is redundant and creates unnecessary clutter. Use a single y-axis on the left with standard black text for the product labels.\n3. **Fix the X-Axis Label:** Change the x-axis label from 'Lives per Kilogram (Direct)' to the more accurate 'Lives per Kilogram', as the axis scale represents the sum of both direct and indirect lives.\n4. **Create an Accurate Legend:** The legend is incorrect and incomplete. It should be replaced with a legend that has two entries: one for the solid red bar section labeled 'Direct Lives' and another for the blue hatched section labeled 'Indirect Lives'.\n5. **Improve Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title ('Animal Products Ranked by Lives Lost Per Kilogram') bold to give it more prominence and improve the overall visual hierarchy."
