    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several compliance and quality issues should be addressed:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the current plot with a proper time series decomposition, showing separate panels for the original series, trend, seasonality, and residuals as requested.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** This plot is empty. It must be populated with data to create the specified slope chart, with lines connecting data points for different countries between the 2013 and 2018 x-axis ticks.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** The chart must be fundamentally changed. The x-axis needs to represent time to show the 'trend of meat yield per animal... over time'. The current categorical axis ('Animal Type') does not meet the requirement.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** Add the required annotation for the 'trend correlation coefficient'. This can be done by adding a text box within the plot area (e.g., 'Correlation: 0.XX').\n\n2.  **Formatting and Text Improvements:**\n    *   **X-Axis Ticks:** The most critical formatting issue is the x-axis labels on time-series plots. In subplots (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2), change the tick labels from floating-point numbers (e.g., '2015.25') to standard integer years (e.g., '2015', '2016', '2017') for clarity and professionalism.\n    *   **Overall Title:** Add a main title (suptitle) to the entire 3x3 figure to provide context for the comprehensive analysis, for example: 'Temporal Evolution of Animal Welfare Practices Across Sectors'.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1) Labels:** The current x-axis labels are long and some are cut off. If this chart type were to be kept, the labels should be shortened (e.g., 'Butter', 'Cheese', 'Ice Cream', 'Yoghurt') or rotated further to avoid overlap.\n\n3.  **Layout Refinements:**\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing (`hspace`) between the rows of subplots slightly to prevent the titles of one row from appearing too close to the plots in the row above."
