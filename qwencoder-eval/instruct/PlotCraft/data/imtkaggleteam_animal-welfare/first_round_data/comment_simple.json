    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Start Over:** Discard the current visualization entirely. \n2. **Chart Type & Layout:** Create a single (1x1 layout) horizontal bar chart. \n3. **Data & Sorting:** Use the correct data, plotting animal products on the y-axis and the number of lives lost per kg on the x-axis. Sort the bars in descending order, with the product causing the most lives lost at the top. \n4. **Text Content:** Add a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Animal Lives Lost per Kilogram of Product'. Label the x-axis 'Number of Lives Lost (per kg)' and the y-axis 'Animal Product'. Ensure all product names are clearly visible as y-tick labels. \n5. **Color Scheme:** Use a distinct, categorical color palette to differentiate between types of animal products (e.g., one color for poultry, another for fish, etc.), as requested. Avoid using a continuous gradient. \n6. **Professional Formatting:** Adopt a professional standard by using a white background, subtle gray gridlines for reference, and a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., a bolded title)."
