    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following specific changes are recommended:\n\n1.  **Overall Formatting:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready style with a white background and subtle, non-distracting gridlines. Increase the vertical spacing between rows (e.g., using `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`) to prevent titles from crowding the plots above them. Reduce the main title font size for a better visual hierarchy.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - UK Egg Production:** The line plot overlay is incorrect. It should show four distinct lines, one for each production system, plotting the percentage change of each system from the base year on the secondary y-axis. Add a label for this secondary axis, such as 'Percentage Change from Base Year'.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Animal Lives Lost:** This is the most significant deviation. The scatter plot must be replaced with a **treemap** as specified in the prompt. The treemap should visualize the hierarchical composition of animal lives lost.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Hen Housing Systems:** Add the missing x-axis label: 'Year'. To make the scatter points meaningful, add a secondary y-axis on the right labeled 'Total Laying Hens (in millions)' to provide scale and context.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Aquatic Animals:** The inner donut chart is currently meaningless. Add a clear legend that maps the colors of the inner segments to the 'lower bound', 'estimate', and 'upper bound' for both 'Fish' and 'Crustaceans'.\n\n6.  **Subplot (2, 0) - Cage vs Cage-free:** Adjust the left margin of the subplot to ensure the full country names (e.g., 'United States') are visible and not truncated.\n\n7.  **Subplot (2, 1) - Transformation:** This chart must be changed from a stacked bar to a proper **waterfall chart**. The 'Additional Impact' bars should be 'floating' bars that start at the top of the 'Direct Lives Lost' bars to visually represent the cumulative addition. The connecting lines should link the top of one component to the bottom of the next."
