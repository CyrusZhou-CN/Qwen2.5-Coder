    "improvement_suggestions": "<Provide specific, actionable suggestions to enhance the chart's visual presentation and overall quality. Focus on concrete improvements that address identified issues in the evaluation scores. Your suggestions should be detailed and precise, specifying exactly which elements need adjustment and where. For charts with multiple subplots, use 0-indexed (row, column) coordinates to specify positions - e.g., 'subplot (0, 0)' for top-left, 'subplot (1, 2)' for second row, third column. Include suggestions for: (1) Element positioning and spacing adjustments, (2) Text formatting improvements (font sizes, weights, orientations), (3) Color scheme enhancements, (4) Legend and annotation optimizations, (5) Layout refinements for better visual hierarchy. Be specific about which subplot, axis, or element requires each adjustment. Avoid generic suggestions - instead provide targeted recommendations that would directly improve the chart's professional appearance and readability.>"
