## Instruction
Create a comprehensive composition analysis showing how different animal products contribute to total animal lives lost. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a stacked bar chart comparing direct vs. total (direct + indirect) lives lost per kilogram for each animal product, and the bottom plot shows a pie chart of the proportion of total lives lost contributed by each animal product type. Use different colors to distinguish between direct and indirect deaths in the stacked bars, and ensure the pie chart clearly shows which animal products have the highest impact on total animal lives lost.
