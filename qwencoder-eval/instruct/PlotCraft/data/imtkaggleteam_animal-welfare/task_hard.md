## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of animal welfare practices across different sectors. Each subplot must combine multiple visualization types:

Top row: (1) Line chart with confidence bands showing farmed fish population estimates (mean, upper, lower bounds) over 2015-2017 with overlaid scatter points for individual country data points, (2) Stacked area chart showing the composition of egg production systems in the UK over time with trend lines for each housing type, (3) Combined bar and line plot showing total vs direct animal lives lost per kg for different animal products with error bars representing the difference between total and direct impacts.

Middle row: (4) Time series decomposition showing seasonal patterns in cage-free egg adoption in the UK with both raw data line and smoothed trend overlay, (5) Dual-axis plot combining line chart of hen population changes over time with bar chart showing the cage vs cage-free distribution percentages, (6) Multi-line chart with markers showing crustacean farming estimates across top 5 producing countries with uncertainty ribbons.

Bottom row: (7) Slope chart with connected scatter points showing the transition from caged to cage-free systems across different countries between 2013 and 2018, (8) Area chart with overlaid box plots showing the distribution and trend of meat yield per animal across different species over time, (9) Composite time series showing correlation between fish farming intensity and crustacean farming with dual y-axes and trend correlation coefficient annotations.
