Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive composition analysis showing how different animal products contribute to animal lives lost per kilogram. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A stacked bar chart comparing direct vs total animal lives lost per kg for each animal product, with bars split to show the direct component and additional indirect component; (2) Top-right: A pie chart showing the composition of total meat production by animal type based on kilograms of meat per animal; (3) Bottom-left: A treemap visualization showing the hierarchical composition of egg production systems in the UK, with different housing types (cages, barns, free-range organic, free-range non-organic) as nested rectangles sized by egg production volume; (4) Bottom-right: A stacked area chart showing the temporal composition changes in egg housing systems share over time, displaying how the proportion of different housing methods (cages, barns, free-range) has evolved.
