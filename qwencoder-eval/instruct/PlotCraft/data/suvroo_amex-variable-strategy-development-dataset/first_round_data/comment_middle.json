    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to comply with the task instructions. To fix this, the entire visualization needs to be recreated to include both the missing correlation heatmap and a pair plot for the top 5 variables, not the top 3. For the existing pair plot, a minor improvement would be to move the legend from inside subplot (0, 0) to a dedicated space outside the plot grid (e.g., to the top right of the entire figure) to prevent it from overlapping with the y-axis label. Additionally, in scatter plots with high data density near the origin, such as subplot (1, 0), consider reducing the alpha (transparency) of the data points to better visualize the concentration of data."
