    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revisions to meet the task requirements and improve quality. \n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections**: The primary focus should be on implementing the correct chart types as specified in the prompt. \n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Convert the standard bar chart into a **diverging bar chart** showing positive/negative deviations from a baseline. Add **error bars** to each bar. \n    *   **Subplot (0, 1)**: Re-implement as a **dumbbell plot** by connecting the pairs of points with horizontal lines. Add **trend lines** if the data supports them. \n    *   **Subplot (1, 2)**: Add **confidence intervals** to the lollipops, for example, as horizontal lines extending from each point. \n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: Add the specified **deviation markers** (e.g., small triangles or dots) to the stacked area chart to highlight key points of deviation. \n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: Overlay a **violin plot** on each box plot to provide a richer view of the data distribution. \n    *   **Subplot (2, 2)**: Add **contour lines** over the heatmap to visualize regions of similar correlation deviation. \n2.  **Layout and Clarity**: \n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between subplot rows to eliminate the overlap between the main title and the top-row subplot titles. In Matplotlib, this can be done using `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`. \n3.  **Text and Data Accuracy**: \n    *   **CRITICAL**: Correct the x-axis on **subplot (1, 0)** and **subplot (2, 0)**. The months must be sorted chronologically (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun) to accurately represent time-series data. \n    *   On **subplot (0, 0)**, the y-axis labels are repetitive. If they represent different segments, clarify them (e.g., 'Segment 1: debt_cap', 'Segment 2: debt_cap'). \n4.  **Visual Refinements**: \n    *   On **subplot (1, 1)**, the lines are very dense. Improve readability by reducing the opacity (alpha) of the lines or by plotting a representative sample of the customer trajectories."
