    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the binning, which makes it useless for its intended purpose. Here are specific suggestions for improvement:\n1.  **Adjust Binning:** The most critical change is to use binning that separates the discrete values of the 'default_ind' variable. Assuming the variable contains only 0s and 1s, the bins should be set to create two distinct bars. For example, setting bins to `[-0.5, 0.5, 1.5]` would create one bar for the value 0 and another for the value 1. Alternatively, a bar chart would be a more suitable chart type for this kind of categorical data.\n2.  **Improve Color:** Replace the harsh, saturated blue with a more professional and visually pleasing shade, such as 'steelblue' or 'cornflowerblue'.\n3.  **Enhance Text Formatting:** Make the title bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy and distinguish it from the axis labels.\n4.  **Refine X-axis Ticks:** The x-axis ticks should be explicitly set to the discrete values in the data (e.g., 0 and 1) to accurately represent the categorical nature of the variable, rather than showing a continuous scale from 0.0 to 1.0."
