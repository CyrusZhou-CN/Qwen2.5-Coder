## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationships between financial variables and default risk in the Amex dataset. First, create a correlation heatmap showing the correlation coefficients between all numerical variables and the default indicator. Then, overlay this with a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) for the top 5 variables most correlated with default risk, where each scatter plot includes both the raw data points and a fitted regression line to highlight the strength and direction of relationships.
