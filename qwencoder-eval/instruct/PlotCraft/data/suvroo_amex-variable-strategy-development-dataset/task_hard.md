# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing deviations from baseline performance across different customer segments and risk factors. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Diverging bar chart with error bars showing deviation of key financial ratios from industry benchmarks by customer segment, (2) Top-middle: Dumbbell plot with trend lines comparing pre/post application metrics for high vs low risk customers, (3) Top-right: Radar chart overlaid with deviation bands showing multi-dimensional risk profile gaps from target thresholds, (4) Middle-left: Area chart with reference lines displaying cumulative deviation patterns in payment behavior over application months, (5) Middle-center: Slope chart combined with scatter plot showing individual customer trajectory deviations from expected default probability paths, (6) Middle-right: Diverging lollipop chart with confidence intervals illustrating variable importance deviations from baseline model predictions, (7) Bottom-left: Stacked area chart with deviation markers showing composition changes in risk categories relative to portfolio averages, (8) Bottom-middle: Box plot with violin overlay highlighting distribution deviations of derived variables across different approval decisions, (9) Bottom-right: Heatmap with diverging color scale and contour lines showing correlation matrix deviations from expected relationships between financial indicators.
