# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between coupon acceptance and driving convenience factors. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a scatter plot with jitter of coupon acceptance (Y) versus driving distance to coupon location (toCoupon_GEQ15min), with points colored by coupon type and sized by whether the destination is in the same direction (direction_same). The bottom plot should display a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between all distance-related variables (toCoupon_GEQ5min, toCoupon_GEQ15min, toCoupon_GEQ25min, direction_same, direction_opp) and coupon acceptance (Y). Add appropriate titles, labels, and legends to clearly communicate how spatial convenience factors influence coupon acceptance decisions.
