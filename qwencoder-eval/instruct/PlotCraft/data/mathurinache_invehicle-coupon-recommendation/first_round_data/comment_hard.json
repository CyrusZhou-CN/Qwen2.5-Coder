    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart, several specific improvements are needed:\n1.  **Global Layout:** Apply a tight layout adjustment (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)`) to improve overall spacing and prevent titles from being too close to the plots above them.\n2.  **Text Overlap:** For all subplots with rotated x-axis labels ((0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)), increase the bottom margin of the subplots or reduce the font size to prevent labels from overlapping or being cut off. Alternatively, for plots like (1,0), consider horizontal labels if space permits.\n3.  **Subplot (0,0):** Implement the `size` aesthetic mapped to 'frequency of restaurant visits' as required. Add a legend that clearly explains both the color (coupon acceptance) and size encodings.\n4.  **Subplot (0,1):** Overlay the requested box plot on the violin plot. Correct the abbreviated x-tick label 'Some col' to 'Some College'.\n5.  **Subplot (0,2):** Ensure bubble size is explicitly mapped to 'coupon acceptance rate' and color is mapped to 'coupon type'. Add a comprehensive legend for these encodings.\n6.  **Subplot (1,2):** This plot must be completely revised. Add the required marginal histograms on the top and right axes to show the distributions of each variable. The current plot with only two data points seems to be a result of incorrect data filtering and is not a useful visualization.\n7.  **Subplot (2,0):** Remove the erroneous 'Marital Status' title above the chart. Add the requested violin plot overlay behind the jitter points. Correct the abbreviated x-tick labels to their full names ('Coffee House', 'Carry Away').\n8.  **Subplot (2,1):** Add the required density overlay to the parallel coordinate lines to show where the most common paths are. This is a critical missing feature for this chart type.\n9.  **Subplot (2,2):** Improve the visibility of the network edges. Increase the opacity and/or use a more saturated color for the edges to make them clearly visible against the white background. Ensure that edge thickness or color intensity clearly corresponds to correlation strength, and consider adding a legend or color bar for this."
