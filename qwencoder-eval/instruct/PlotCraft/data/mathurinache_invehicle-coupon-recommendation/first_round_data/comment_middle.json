    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to adhere to the task prompt. The entire visualization needs to be recreated to meet the specified requirements.\n1.  **Layout and Chart Types:** Implement the required 2x1 subplot layout. The top subplot (0, 0) must be the specified scatter plot with jitter. The bottom subplot (1, 0) should be the generated heatmap.\n2.  **Scatter Plot Implementation (Subplot 0, 0):** Create the scatter plot with 'toCoupon_GEQ15min' on the x-axis and 'Y' (coupon acceptance) on the y-axis. Apply jitter to the points. Color the points based on 'coupon type' and vary their size based on 'direction_same'. Add a clear legend for both color and size.\n3.  **Titles:** Add a main, overarching title for the entire 2x1 figure, such as 'Analysis of Driving Convenience on Coupon Acceptance'. Then, give each subplot its own specific title. The current title is perfect for the bottom heatmap (subplot 1, 0). The top scatter plot (subplot 0, 0) could be titled 'Coupon Acceptance vs. Driving Distance'.\n4.  **Text Formatting:** Remove the trailing hyphens from the y-axis tick labels on the heatmap for a cleaner appearance (e.g., 'toCoupon_GEQ5min -' should be 'toCoupon_GEQ5min').\n5.  **Overall Layout Adjustment:** After creating the 2x1 layout, use a function like `tight_layout()` to ensure there is appropriate spacing between the two subplots and that no labels or titles are cut off."
