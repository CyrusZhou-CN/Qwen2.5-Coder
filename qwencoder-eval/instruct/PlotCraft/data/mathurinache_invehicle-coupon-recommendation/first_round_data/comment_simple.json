    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to correct the representation of the x-axis. Since the data is binary (accepted/rejected), the chart should use a categorical x-axis instead of a continuous one. \n\n1.  **X-Axis Correction:** Change the x-axis to be categorical with two labels: 'Rejected' and 'Accepted'. The two stacked bars should be centered over these labels, not spread across a continuous range.\n2.  **Alternative Chart Type:** Consider a grouped bar chart instead of a stacked one. This would place bars for each 'Coupon Type' side-by-side for 'Rejected' and 'Accepted', making it much easier to compare the counts of different coupon types within each category.\n3.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Improve the text formatting to create a clear hierarchy. Make the chart title larger (e.g., 16pt) and bold to distinguish it from the axis labels (e.g., 12pt).\n4.  **Color Palette:** Select a more distinct qualitative color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer) to ensure each coupon type is easily distinguishable at a glance.\n5.  **Bar Width:** Reduce the width of the bars to be more conventional for a bar chart, which will also improve the balance of white space in the plot."
