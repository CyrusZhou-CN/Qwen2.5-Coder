    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revisions to meet the prompt and achieve a professional standard. \n1. **Layout Refinements:** The most critical issue is spacing. Apply a global layout adjustment, such as `tight_layout()` with padding, to create adequate vertical and horizontal space between all subplots. This will prevent titles from overlapping with the plots above them and ensure axis labels are not cut off. A suggested starting point would be `hspace=0.6` and `wspace=0.3`.\n2. **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** The second y-axis should display market share as distinct *line plots*, not another stacked area chart, as requested in the prompt.\n   - **Subplot (1, 2):** The required 'overlaid bar chart showing company market dominance periods' is missing. This is a complex requirement; a feasible alternative would be to add a separate, small bar chart below the radar chart, linked by company color, as a direct overlay is non-standard and would be unreadable.\n   - **Subplot (2, 0):** This must be re-implemented as a proper time series heatmap using `pcolormesh` or a similar function. The x-axis should represent 'Year', the y-axis 'Generation', and the cell color should represent console release intensity. The current 'Release Year Index' is not meaningful.\n   - **Subplot (2, 1):** This chart must be converted from a line chart to a *slope chart*. A slope chart specifically visualizes the change in a metric between two points (in this case, consecutive generations) and is structurally different from a continuous line chart.\n3. **Text and Labeling Improvements:**\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** Correct the y-axis label. If it represents market share, it should be 'Market Share (%)'. If it represents sales, it should be 'Units Sold (millions)'.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** Change the y-axis label from 'Individual Company Sales' to the more specific 'Units Sold (millions)'.\n   - **Subplot (2, 2):** Change the y-axis label from 'Sales Impact (millions)' to 'Units Sold (millions)' for clarity and consistency.\n4. **Color Scheme Enhancements:**\n   - Establish a consistent color mapping for companies (e.g., Nintendo is always red, Sony is always blue) across all relevant subplots ((1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)) to improve cross-chart readability.\n   - In subplot (1, 0), reduce the saturation of the primary colors to make the chart less jarring.\n   - In subplot (2, 0), remove the pale yellow background and use a standard white background to match the rest of the figure."
