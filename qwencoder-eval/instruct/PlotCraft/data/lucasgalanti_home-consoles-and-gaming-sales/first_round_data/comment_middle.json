    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart, several improvements can be made:\n1.  **Chart Type Correction:** The top chart (subplot (0, 0)) should be changed from a horizontal bar chart to a stacked bar chart to comply with the task instruction. If the data represents only totals, a simple bar chart is more appropriate, and the prompt should be reconsidered. Assuming the goal is to show totals, the current bar chart is effective but non-compliant.\n2.  **Resolve Label Overlap:** The most critical issue is the overlapping labels in the pie chart (subplot (1, 0)). This can be fixed by:\n    *   Using a legend instead of direct labels for the company names.\n    *   Employing leader lines (callouts) to position the labels for smaller slices ('Atari', 'Mattel', 'Magnavox') away from the pie, ensuring they are clearly legible.\n    *   Grouping the smallest slices (e.g., Mattel, Magnavox, Atari) into an 'Other' category to declutter the visualization.\n3.  **Layout and Titling:**\n    *   Add individual titles to each subplot for clarity, such as 'Total Units Sold (Millions)' for the top chart and 'Overall Market Share' for the bottom chart.\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between the two subplots to create better visual separation.\n4.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Make the main title ('Market Share Composition by Gaming Console Companies') bold to establish a stronger visual hierarchy.\n    *   Reduce the `explode` effect on the pie chart slices for a cleaner, more professional appearance. A slight explosion for one or two key slices is effective, but exploding all of them creates unnecessary visual noise."
