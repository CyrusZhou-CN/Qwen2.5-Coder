## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of gaming console market dynamics across generations. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Generation Analysis): (1) Stacked area chart showing cumulative console units sold over time with overlaid line plots for each generation's market share percentage, (2) Bar chart of total units sold per generation with overlaid scatter plot showing average console lifespan (discontinuation year - release year) per generation, (3) Dual-axis plot combining box plots of console sales distribution by generation with line chart showing the number of consoles released per generation.

Middle row (Company Performance): (4) Stacked bar chart of market share by company across generations with overlaid line plot showing each company's average console sales trend, (5) Bubble chart where x-axis is release year, y-axis is units sold, bubble size represents console lifespan, colored by company, with trend lines for each company, (6) Radar chart comparing companies across multiple metrics (total units sold, number of consoles released, average lifespan) with overlaid bar chart showing company market dominance periods.

Bottom row (Temporal Patterns): (7) Time series heatmap showing console release intensity by year and generation with overlaid line plot of cumulative market growth, (8) Slope chart connecting console sales performance between consecutive generations for the same companies, with background area chart showing overall market expansion, (9) Multi-layered area chart showing the overlap periods of console lifecycles (release to discontinuation) across all generations, with scatter plot overlay marking peak sales years and trend line showing market maturation.
