Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the market share composition of gaming console companies across different generations. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a stacked bar chart showing the total units sold by each company across all generations, and the bottom plot shows a pie chart representing the overall market share percentage of each company based on total console sales. Use appropriate color schemes to maintain consistency between the two plots and ensure company names are clearly labeled.
