    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. \n\n1.  **Start Over:** Discard the current visualization entirely.\n2.  **Layout & Formatting:**\n    *   Create a 2x1 layout (two rows, one column) with a white background.\n    *   Use black or dark gray for all text and axes for a professional look.\n    *   Ensure sufficient vertical spacing between the two subplots.\n3.  **Top Subplot (0, 0) - Scatter Plot:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Generate a proper scatter plot.\n    *   **Axes:** Set the Y-axis to 'GDP per Capita (USD)' (consider a log scale) and the X-axis to 'Life Expectancy (years)'.\n    *   **Data Encoding:** Each point should represent a country. The *size* of the point must be proportional to its population, and the *color* must represent its continent.\n    *   **Trend Lines:** Add a separate regression line for each continent (i.e., for each color group).\n    *   **Legend:** Include a clear legend for the continent colors.\n    *   **Title:** Use a descriptive title like 'GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy by Continent (2007)'.\n4.  **Bottom Subplot (1, 0) - Correlation Heatmap:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Generate a proper heatmap, not an area chart.\n    *   **Data:** The heatmap should visualize a 3x3 correlation matrix for 'GDP per capita', 'life expectancy', and 'population'.\n    *   **Appearance:** Annotate each cell with the correlation coefficient. Use a diverging colormap (e.g., red-white-blue) to represent negative, neutral, and positive correlations.\n    *   **Labels:** Label the axes of the heatmap with the variable names.\n    *   **Title:** Use a clear title like 'Correlation Matrix for Economic and Health Indicators'."
