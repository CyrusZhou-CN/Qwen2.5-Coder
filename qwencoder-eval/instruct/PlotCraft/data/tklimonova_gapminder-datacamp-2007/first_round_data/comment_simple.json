Here are the steps to create the correct chart:\n1.  **Start Fresh:** Create a new, single-panel (1x1 layout) figure.\n2.  **Correct Chart Type:** Use a scatter plot to visualize the data.\n3.  **Data Mapping:**\n    *   Plot 'GDP per capita' on the x-axis.\n    *   Plot 'life expectancy' on the y-axis.\n    *   Use the 'continent' data to assign a unique color to the points for each continent.\n    *   Use the 'population' data to scale the size of the points, creating a bubble chart effect.\n4.  **Labels and Title:**\n    *   Add a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita by Continent (2007)'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'GDP per Capita'.\n    *   Label the y-axis as 'Life Expectancy'.\n5.  **Legend:** Include a legend that clearly explains which color corresponds to which continent. It would also be beneficial to add a legend for the bubble sizes to indicate population levels.\n6.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Remove the heavy black borders and use standard, thinner axis lines.\n    *   Use a professional and legible font for all text.\n    *   Choose a color-blind friendly, qualitative color palette for the continents to ensure clear differentiation.\n    *   Ensure all elements are well-spaced with no overlaps."
