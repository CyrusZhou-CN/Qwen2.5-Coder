    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not meet any of the task requirements. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 3x3 subplot grid as specified in the prompt.\n2.  **Content and Chart Type:** For each of the nine subplot positions, generate the exact chart type with the correct data as described in the instruction. For example:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the pie chart with a stacked bar chart (attack distribution by protocol) and an overlaid line plot (average packet rates).\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the empty plot with a bubble plot (duration vs. bytes, size=packets, color=category) with density contours.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2):** Create the specified violin plot with overlaid box plots.\n    *   Continue this process for all nine subplots as detailed in the prompt.\n3.  **Data:** Use data from the Bot-IoT dataset to analyze network attack patterns, not the nonsensical placeholder data currently shown.\n4.  **Text and Labels:** Remove all the overlapping, chaotic text ('OVERLAPPING TEXT CHAOS', etc.). All titles, axis labels, and legends must be accurate, descriptive, and relevant to the network data being visualized. For example, the title for subplot (0,0) should be something like 'Attack Distribution by Protocol and Packet Rate', not 'Pizza Distribution Analysis'.\n5.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Switch to a professional theme with a white background and black/dark gray text.\n    *   Use a clear and harmonious color palette to distinguish between the specified attack categories (Normal, DoS, DDoS, Reconnaissance). Avoid the current jarring primary colors.\n    *   Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Adjust spacing between subplots for clarity.\n    *   Establish a proper visual hierarchy by making the main title for each subplot bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
