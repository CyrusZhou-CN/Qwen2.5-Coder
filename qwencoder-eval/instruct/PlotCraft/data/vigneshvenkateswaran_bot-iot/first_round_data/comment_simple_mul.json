Choose a professional, harmonious color palette (e.g., sequential or qualitative palettes from ColorBrewer) instead of the current neon colors.\n    *   Add a clear legend that maps each color to its corresponding attack category.\n4.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Provide a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Composition of Network Attack Types by Protocol'.\n    *   Ensure all axis labels ('Protocol' for x-axis, 'Proportion' for y-axis) are legible and correctly describe the data.\n5.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   Use a standard professional theme with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. All text, bars, and the legend should be clearly separated.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy, with the title being the most prominent text element (e.g., larger font size and bold)."
