    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure to comply with the user's prompt and needs to be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Task Compliance:** The primary goal is to create a single pie chart. Discard the 2x2 layout and all existing plots (bar, scatter, line).\n2. **Chart Type and Data:** Generate a single pie chart that visualizes the percentage distribution of the 'DoS', 'DDoS', and 'Reconnaissance' attack categories.\n3. **Labels and Annotations:** Each slice of the pie chart must be clearly labeled with both the attack category name and its calculated percentage (e.g., 'DDoS: 45%'). Add a clear, descriptive title such as 'Distribution of Attack Categories in Bot-IoT Dataset'. Include the total number of attack records analyzed either in the title or as a separate text annotation (e.g., 'Total Attack Records Analyzed: 4,100,000').\n4. **Professional Formatting:** \n   - **Background and Colors:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready style. Use a white background. Replace the harsh neon colors with a standard, harmonious, and colorblind-friendly palette (e.g., Matplotlib's 'Tableau10' or 'Paired' colormaps).\n   - **Typography:** Use a standard, readable font like Sans-Serif. The main title should be bold and slightly larger than other text to create a clear visual hierarchy. Ensure all labels are legible and do not overlap.\n   - **Remove Clutter:** Eliminate all irrelevant and distracting elements, such as the 'Quantum Blockchain' theme, the 'Data Processing...' text, and the unrelated plots."
