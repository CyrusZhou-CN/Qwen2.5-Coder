    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to meet the task requirements and needs to be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Layout and Structure:**\n    *   Implement the correct 2x2 subplot grid. Ensure adequate spacing between subplots to avoid a cramped appearance.\n\n2.  **Chart Implementation (per subplot):**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a stacked bar chart showing attack categories per protocol. Add a line plot overlay, possibly using a secondary y-axis, for the average packet count.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Generate a pie chart for attack subcategories. Annotate each slice with both percentage and absolute values. Create a smaller, nested donut chart in the center to show the malicious vs. benign traffic split.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Construct a horizontal stacked bar chart (`barh`) for source IP composition per attack category. Overlay this with a scatter plot to show the average bytes transferred.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Use a suitable library (e.g., `squarify`) to build the treemap with the specified hierarchy. Ensure rectangle sizes are proportional to record counts and colors map to attack duration.\n\n3.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Theme:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready theme. Use a white background, black text, and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Replace the current neon colors with a professional, harmonious color palette. Use distinct but not jarring colors to differentiate categories.\n    *   **Text Content:** All titles, axis labels, and legends must be corrected to accurately reflect the data as described in the prompt (e.g., 'Distribution of Attack Categories by Protocol', 'Overall Attack Composition', etc.). Remove all nonsensical titles and distracting text annotations like 'CRITICAL ALERT'.\n    *   **Text Formatting:** Ensure all text is horizontal for maximum readability. Establish a clear typographic hierarchy with a bold main title and slightly smaller subplot titles."
