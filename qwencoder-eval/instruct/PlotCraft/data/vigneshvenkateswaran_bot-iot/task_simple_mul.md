# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a stacked bar chart showing the composition of network attack types across different protocols. Use the 'category', 'subcategory', and 'proto' columns from multiple data files to show how different attack categories (DoS, DDoS, Reconnaissance, Normal) are distributed across TCP and UDP protocols. The chart should display the proportion of each attack subcategory within each protocol type, with clear labels and a legend to distinguish between different attack types.
