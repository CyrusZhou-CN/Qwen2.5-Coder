## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive pricing deviation analysis across multiple e-commerce platforms by combining data from three key files. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot shows the deviation of platform-specific MRPs from a baseline reference price. In the top-left, create a diverging bar chart showing how Amazon MRP deviates from the average MRP across all platforms for each product category. In the top-right, display a diverging lollipop chart comparing Myntra MRP deviations from the Final MRP Old baseline. In the bottom-left, construct a dumbbell plot showing the price range between the lowest platform MRP and highest platform MRP for each Style ID, highlighting the pricing spread. In the bottom-right, create an area chart with error bands showing the deviation of actual sale amounts from expected amounts (based on MRP) over different order statuses, using the Amazon sales data. Each subplot should use different colors to distinguish positive and negative deviations, and include reference lines at zero deviation.
