# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing pricing deviations across e-commerce platforms. First, create a diverging bar chart showing the percentage deviation of each platform's MRP from the average MRP across all platforms for each product style. Second, overlay a line plot on the same chart showing the cost-to-price ratio (TP/MRP) for each style to identify which products have the highest markup potential. Use different colors to highlight styles where platform pricing shows high variance (standard deviation > 10% of mean) versus low variance styles.
