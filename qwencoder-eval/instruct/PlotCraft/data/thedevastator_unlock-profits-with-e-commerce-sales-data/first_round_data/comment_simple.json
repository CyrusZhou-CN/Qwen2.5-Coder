    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated visualization is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. The current charts are irrelevant and should be discarded.\n\nTo meet the task requirements, follow these steps:\n1.  **Chart Type & Layout:** Create a single plot (1x1 layout) using a histogram as the chart type. Do not use a pie chart or a standalone line chart.\n2.  **Data Visualization:**\n    *   The histogram bars should represent the frequency distribution of 'order amounts' from the Amazon sales data.\n    *   Overlay a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve on top of the histogram to show a smoothed version of the distribution.\n3.  **Text Content:**\n    *   **Title:** Change the title to something informative and relevant, such as 'Distribution of Amazon Order Amounts'.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** The x-axis must be labeled 'Order Amount' (including currency if known, e.g., 'Order Amount (INR)'). The y-axis should be labeled 'Frequency' or 'Density'.\n4.  **Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Background & Grid:** Use a standard white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines that do not distract from the data.\n    *   **Colors:** Use a professional color palette. For example, use a light, neutral color (e.g., light blue or gray) for the histogram bars and a distinct, contrasting color (e.g., dark blue or orange) for the KDE line to make it stand out.\n    *   **Professionalism:** Ensure the final chart has a clean, polished look suitable for a formal report. The title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
