    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data Correction**: The top priority is to fix the data. Recalculate the 'Avg MRP' so that each product category displays its own unique, correct average MRP. Ensure that the top 10 categories are plotted as requested, not 9. Correct the y-axis labels for the bottom categories to show the full, accurate product category names (e.g., 'B', 'D', 'Ethnic [...]' are incorrect).\n2. **Handle Data Skew**: The vast difference in sales amounts makes a linear scale ineffective. Use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis ('Total Sales Amount') to make the variations between all categories, including the smaller ones, visible and comparable. If you use a log scale, clearly state this in the x-axis label or title (e.g., 'Total Sales Amount (INR, log scale)').\n3. **Improve Annotation Clarity**: Reposition the annotations to eliminate all overlap. For the very short bars, place the text labels (both total sales and Avg MRP) to the right of the bar ends instead of inside them. For example, you could have the total sales value at the end of the bar, and the 'Avg MRP' on a new line below it, aligned to the right.\n4. **Enhance Layout and Spacing**: Increase the vertical space between each bar to prevent the y-axis labels and annotations from feeling cramped. Adjust the left margin of the plot to ensure all product category names on the y-axis are fully visible without being truncated."
