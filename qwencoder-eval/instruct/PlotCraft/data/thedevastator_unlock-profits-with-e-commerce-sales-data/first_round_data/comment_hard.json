    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus on fulfilling the prompt's requirements and enhancing visual consistency. \n1. **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Implement the requested background area chart for 'Cumulative Sales' using the existing secondary y-axis.\n   - **Subplot (1,1):** Add the missing overlaid histogram to show the distribution of price-to-sale amount ratios.\n   - **Subplot (2,0):** Change the chart from a grouped bar to a stacked diverging bar chart. Add the required line plots to track expense trends over time.\n\n2. **Text and Legend Improvements:**\n   - **Subplot (2,0):** Add a legend to identify 'TP1 Deviation' and 'TP2 Deviation'. Investigate and clean the 'Nill' data point on the y-axis.\n   - **Global:** Standardize the font sizes for all axis labels, tick labels, and titles across all 9 subplots for a more unified appearance.\n   - **Annotations:** Add the requested annotations to highlight key insights, such as labeling the category with the highest deviation in (1,0) or pointing out a significant outlier in (0,1).\n\n3. **Visual and Layout Refinements:**\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** Improve the overlay by either making the box plots more transparent or changing the background bars to lollipops so both layers are clearly visible.\n   - **Subplot (1,2):** Slightly increase the plot's margin or reduce the legend's font size to prevent it from overlapping with the chart's border.\n   - **Color Scheme:** Adopt a consistent, professional color palette for the entire grid. Use the same colors for positive/negative deviations (e.g., blue/red) and the same categorical palette for product types or platforms across all relevant subplots."
