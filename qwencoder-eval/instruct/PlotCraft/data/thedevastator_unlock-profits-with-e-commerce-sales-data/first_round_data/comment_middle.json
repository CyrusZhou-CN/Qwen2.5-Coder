    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Implement the Core Chart:** The primary issue is the complete absence of the requested diverging bar chart. This needs to be created first. For each 'Product Style' on the y-axis, plot horizontal bars representing the 'Percentage Deviation from Average MRP' for each e-commerce platform. Bars should extend left for negative deviations and right for positive deviations from a central zero line.\n2. **Correct the Line Plot:** The line plot for the 'cost-to-price ratio' is incorrectly implemented. It should be overlaid using the secondary y-axis on the right. This axis must be explicitly labeled 'Cost-to-Price Ratio' and its scale should reflect the data (e.g., 0.0 to 0.5, based on the stated average of 0.261). The line should connect points corresponding to each 'Product Style'.\n3. **Fix Legends and Text:** Remove the 'E-commerce Platforms' legend for now. Once the bar chart is implemented, this legend should be used to assign a unique color to the bars for each platform. The 'Key Insights' text box must be corrected; the 'Deviation range' value is factually wrong and needs to be recalculated from the actual data shown on the x-axis.\n4. **Refine Color for Variance:** The instruction to use color for high/low variance styles should be applied more effectively. Instead of coloring the line plot, consider coloring the y-axis labels ('Product Styles') or using a subtle background highlight for the rows corresponding to high-variance styles to draw attention to them.\n5. **Improve Layout:** Adding the diverging bar chart will naturally fix the empty space issue. Ensure the final placement of the legends and the 'Key Insights' box is balanced and does not obstruct any data."
