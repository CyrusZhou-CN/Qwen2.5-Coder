    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to generate the chart in subplot (1, 1); the underlying data processing needs to be fixed to create the requested area chart. For the existing plots: \n1. **Subplot (0, 0):** Add a vertical reference line at x=0 to comply with the instruction to 'include reference lines at zero deviation'. This will also make it clearer that all deviations are positive.\n2. **Subplot (0, 1):** Update the x-axis label from 'Deviation from Final MRP Old' to 'Deviation from Final MRP Old (₹)' to ensure consistency with the label in subplot (0, 0).\n3. **Subplot (1, 0):** The red/green color combination for 'Min MRP' and 'Max MRP' is not ideal for colorblind viewers. Consider using a more accessible color pair, such as blue and orange.\n4. **Overall Layout:** While the current layout is good, adding a main title (suptitle) to the entire figure, such as 'Comprehensive Pricing Deviation Analysis Across E-commerce Platforms', would provide better overall context for the 2x2 grid."
