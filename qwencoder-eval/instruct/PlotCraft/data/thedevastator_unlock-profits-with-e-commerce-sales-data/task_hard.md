# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing profit margin deviations and pricing strategies across multiple e-commerce platforms. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Platform Pricing Analysis
- Subplot 1: Create a diverging bar chart showing MRP deviations from the average MRP across all platforms (Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm), overlaid with error bars indicating pricing variance by category
- Subplot 2: Combine a violin plot showing MRP distribution across platforms with scatter points representing individual SKUs, highlighting outliers that deviate significantly from platform norms
- Subplot 3: Design a dumbbell plot comparing TP1 vs TP2 costs with a secondary y-axis line chart showing the profit margin deviation from target margins

Row 2: Sales Performance Deviations
- Subplot 4: Create a diverging lollipop chart showing quantity sold deviations from expected sales by category, combined with a background area chart showing cumulative sales trends
- Subplot 5: Build a slope chart connecting Amazon sale amounts to their respective MRPs, overlaid with a histogram showing the distribution of price-to-sale amount ratios
- Subplot 6: Construct a radar chart showing multi-dimensional performance metrics (sales volume, profit margin, pricing deviation) by category, with reference lines indicating target benchmarks

Row 3: Cost Structure and Profitability Deviations
- Subplot 7: Design a stacked diverging bar chart showing cost component deviations (TP1, TP2) from industry standards, combined with line plots tracking expense trends over time
- Subplot 8: Create a bubble plot where x-axis shows MRP deviation from cost price, y-axis shows sales volume deviation from average, and bubble size represents total profit, with color coding by fulfillment method
- Subplot 9: Build a combination chart with diverging bars showing profit margin deviations by SKU and an overlaid box plot showing the distribution of margins across different sales channels

Each subplot should include appropriate reference lines, color coding for positive/negative deviations, and clear annotations highlighting significant outliers or patterns.
