# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing profit margin deviations and pricing strategies across multiple e-commerce platforms. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots):
1. Left: Create a diverging bar chart showing the deviation of each platform's MRP from the average MRP, overlaid with error bars representing the standard deviation of pricing across different style categories
2. Center: Design a dumbbell plot comparing TP1 vs TP2 costs for different product categories, with a secondary y-axis line plot showing the profit margin percentage deviation from the overall average margin
3. Right: Build a slope chart showing MRP changes from "MRP Old" to "Final MRP Old" for top 10 style IDs, combined with scatter points indicating the magnitude of price adjustment

Bottom row (2 subplots):
4. Left: Construct a diverging lollipop chart displaying how each platform's MRP deviates from the baseline Amazon MRP, with horizontal reference lines showing ±10% and ±20% deviation thresholds
5. Right: Generate a radar chart comparing normalized pricing metrics (TP1, TP2, various platform MRPs) for the top 5 most frequent style categories, overlaid with area fill showing the deviation range from the category median

Use a consistent color scheme where positive deviations are shown in green tones and negative deviations in red tones. Include proper titles, legends, and annotations highlighting the most significant deviations. The visualization should reveal pricing inconsistencies, profit margin variations, and strategic pricing patterns across different e-commerce platforms.
