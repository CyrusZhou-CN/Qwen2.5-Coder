    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus first on meeting the task requirements, then on refining the visual presentation.\n\n**Task Compliance Corrections:**\n1.  **Subplot (0,1):** Add violin plots behind the existing box plots to show the full data distribution as requested.\n2.  **Subplot (0,2):** Replace the current visualization. Create a heatmap showing the correlation between hourly temperature and PM2.5, and then overlay the scatter plot points on top of the heatmap cells.\n3.  **Subplot (2,0):** Replace the single scatter plot with a scatter plot matrix (e.g., a pair plot) to show the relationships between wind speed, temperature, and PM2.5 simultaneously. Ensure regression lines include confidence intervals.\n4.  **Subplot (2,1):** Overlay Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curves on top of the histograms for each wind direction category to provide a smoother representation of the distributions.\n5.  **Subplot (2,2):** Add the 'Residuals' component from the time series decomposition as a third line plot to complete the analysis as requested.\n\n**Visual Refinements:**\n1.  **Layout & Spacing:** Use a layout adjustment tool (like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`) to reduce the excessive white space around the entire 3x3 grid, making the plots larger and more prominent.\n2.  **Color Scheme:** Implement a consistent color palette across the entire figure. For instance, use the same distinct color for 'PM2.5' in every subplot where it appears. In subplot (1,0), select four more easily distinguishable colors for the different stations.\n3.  **Text & Labels:** Increase the font size of all axis labels and tick labels by 1-2 points for better readability. Make labels more descriptive: change 'Time Period' in (2,2) to a more specific unit (e.g., 'Observation Index' or 'Day'). Add a right-side y-axis label for 'Temperature (°C)' in subplot (1,1) to match the style of the dual-axis plot in (1,2).\n4.  **Element Positioning:** Reposition the color bar in subplot (2,0). Consider placing it horizontally above the plot title or using a grid specification to create a dedicated, narrow space for it to the right, preventing it from unbalancing the column's width."
