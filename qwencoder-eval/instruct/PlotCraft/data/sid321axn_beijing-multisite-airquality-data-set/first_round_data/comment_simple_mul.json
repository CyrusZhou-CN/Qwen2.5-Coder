    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the overlapping of opaque histograms, which makes comparison impossible. To fix this, the visualization approach must be changed:\n\n1.  **Change Histogram Type for Clarity**: The most effective solution is to change the histogram type to a 'step' plot. This will draw only the outlines of the distributions, allowing all three to be compared clearly without any overlap. Alternatively, re-plot the histograms with a high degree of transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.5`) so that the underlying bars are visible.\n2.  **Adjust Binning**: The current chart has approximately 19 bins. The instruction requested 20-30 bins. Explicitly set the number of bins to a value in this range, such as `bins=25`, to better comply with the task and potentially reveal more detail in the distributions.\n3.  **Improve Visual Hierarchy**: Make the chart title bold to distinguish it from the axis labels. This creates a stronger typographic hierarchy and improves the professional appearance of the chart.\n4.  **Refine Axis Limits**: Consider adjusting the x-axis limit to better fit the data range (e.g., from 0 to 190) to reduce the empty white space on the right side of the plot."
