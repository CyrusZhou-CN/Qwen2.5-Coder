    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is of high quality but completely fails to meet the requirements of the task prompt. The primary improvement is to discard the current visualization and create a new one that follows the instructions precisely.\n\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Change the layout from the current 2x3 grid to the specified 3x2 grid.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - PM2.5 Time Series:** Replace the current plot with a time series line chart showing PM2.5 concentrations from 2013-2017 for the four specified stations (Aotizhongxin, Dongsi, Wanliu, Tiantan). Overlay 7-day rolling average trend lines and include shaded error bands to show daily variance.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - PM2.5 vs. Temperature:** Create the requested dual-axis plot. Use a bar chart for monthly average PM2.5 levels and a line chart for temperature trends over the same period.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Pollutant Composition:** Implement a stacked area chart to show the changing composition of the six major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) over time for the central Beijing area.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Seasonal Slope Chart:** Generate a slope chart connecting the seasonal PM2.5 averages (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) for each monitoring station to compare seasonal shifts.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 0) - Calendar Heatmap:** Create a calendar heatmap for the year 2015 showing daily PM2.5 levels, and combine it with a wind direction rose plot for the same period.\n7.  **Subplot (2, 1) - Time Series Decomposition:** For the most polluted station, create a time series decomposition plot that clearly separates the trend, seasonal, and residual components of the PM2.5 data, and include an autocorrelation analysis overlay.\n8.  **Data Scope:** Ensure all plots analyze data from the 2013-2017 period as requested, rather than the current focus on hourly (diurnal) patterns."
