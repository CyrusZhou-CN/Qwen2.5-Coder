    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to comply with the task prompt. \n1. **Complete Content Correction**: The entire visualization must be recreated from scratch. \n    - **Subplot (0, 0)**: Must be a correlation heatmap of pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3.\n    - **Subplot (0, 1)**: Must be a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) for PM2.5, NO2, and O3, with points colored by station.\n    - **Subplot (1, 0)**: Must be a bubble plot with PM2.5 on the x-axis, NO2 on the y-axis, bubble size mapped to CO levels, and color mapped to the station.\n    - **Subplot (1, 1)**: Must be a scatter plot of PM2.5 vs. PM10, with distinct, colored regression lines for each station.\n2. **Layout and Title**: \n    - Remove the current overlapping main title. A new, accurate main title (e.g., 'Comprehensive Correlation Analysis of Air Pollutants in Beijing') should be added using `plt.suptitle()` with its vertical position adjusted (e.g., `y=1.0`) to prevent any overlap with subplot titles.\n    - Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to fix the excessive vertical gap between the rows and ensure all subplots are equally sized for a balanced grid.\n3. **Color and Legend**: \n    - For the plots that color-code by station, replace the current pastel palette with a color map that offers better visual distinction for 12 categories, such as 'tab20' or a manually defined set of distinct colors.\n    - Ensure legends are clear and do not obstruct data. For the bubble plot, a legend explaining the bubble sizes (e.g., showing 3-4 representative CO levels) should be included.\n4. **Text and Labels**: \n    - All titles, axis labels, and legend entries must be updated to reflect the correct variables as specified in the prompt for each of the four new plots."
