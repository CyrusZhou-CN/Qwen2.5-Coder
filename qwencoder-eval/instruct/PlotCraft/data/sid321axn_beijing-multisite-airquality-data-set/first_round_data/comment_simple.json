    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards. \n1. **Data and Content Correction**: The fundamental issue is the incorrect data and labels. The chart must be regenerated to show the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations. \n   - **Title**: Change to 'Distribution of PM2.5 Concentrations in Beijing'.\n   - **X-axis Label**: Change to 'PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)' or a similar appropriate label.\n   - **Y-axis Label**: Change to 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n   - **Legend**: The legend is unnecessary for a single-series histogram and should be removed entirely.\n2. **Binning and Color**: \n   - The number of bins must be set to 30 as specified in the prompt.\n   - Replace the jarring green and red colors with a more professional palette. Use a single, muted color (e.g., steel blue or gray) for the bars.\n   - Apply a semi-transparent fill (e.g., `alpha=0.7`) as requested in the prompt.\n   - The bar edge color should be a darker shade of the fill color or black, not a clashing color like red.\n3. **Formatting for Professionalism**:\n   - Switch to a professional style with a white background and remove the gray theme.\n   - Make the gridlines more subtle (e.g., light gray, dashed, and thinner) or remove them.\n   - Create a clear visual hierarchy by making the title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n   - For a cleaner look, consider removing the top and right chart borders (spines)."
