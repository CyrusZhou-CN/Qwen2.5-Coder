## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid to examine relationships between air pollutants across multiple Beijing monitoring stations. In the top-left subplot, create a correlation heatmap showing the correlation coefficients between PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 for all stations combined. In the top-right subplot, create a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) focusing on PM2.5, NO2, and O3 relationships with different colors for each station. In the bottom-left subplot, create a bubble plot where x-axis is PM2.5, y-axis is NO2, bubble size represents CO levels, and colors represent different stations. In the bottom-right subplot, create a scatter plot with regression lines showing the relationship between PM2.5 and PM10 for each station, with each station having its own color and trend line. Use data from at least 6 different monitoring stations to reveal spatial patterns in pollutant correlations across Beijing.
