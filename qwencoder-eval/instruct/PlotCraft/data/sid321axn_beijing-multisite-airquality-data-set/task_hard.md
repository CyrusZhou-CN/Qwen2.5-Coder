## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing temporal patterns in Beijing's air quality data across multiple monitoring stations. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Daily Pattern Analysis
- Subplot 1: Overlay line plots showing average hourly PM2.5 concentrations for 3 different stations (Aotizhongxin, Dongsi, Wanliu) with error bands showing standard deviation
- Subplot 2: Combine box plots and violin plots showing the distribution of PM10 levels by hour of day across all stations
- Subplot 3: Create a heatmap showing correlation between hourly temperature and PM2.5 levels with scatter plot overlay for one representative station

Row 2: Seasonal Variation Analysis  
- Subplot 4: Multi-line time series showing monthly average PM2.5 trends for 4 stations with filled area charts underneath each line
- Subplot 5: Combine stacked bar charts showing monthly pollutant composition (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2) with line overlay showing temperature trends
- Subplot 6: Create dual-axis plot with bar chart showing monthly rainfall totals and line plot showing corresponding air quality index trends

Row 3: Weather Impact Analysis
- Subplot 7: Scatter plot matrix showing relationships between wind speed, temperature, and PM2.5 with regression lines and confidence intervals
- Subplot 8: Combine histogram and KDE curves showing distribution of PM2.5 levels under different wind direction categories (calm, north, south, east, west winds)
- Subplot 9: Create a complex time series decomposition plot showing PM2.5 trend, seasonal component, and residuals with multiple overlaid trend lines

Each subplot must integrate at least two different visualization techniques and reveal insights about how air quality changes over time and responds to meteorological conditions.
