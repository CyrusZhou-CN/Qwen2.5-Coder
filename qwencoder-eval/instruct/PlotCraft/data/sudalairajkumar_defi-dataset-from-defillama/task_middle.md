## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot visualization analyzing the evolution of DeFi protocols over time. In the top-left subplot, create a stacked area chart showing the TVL (Total Value Locked) evolution over time for the top 5 DeFi protocol categories, with each category represented by a different color and transparency. In the top-right subplot, create a line chart with markers showing the monthly growth rate of total TVL across all protocols, overlaid with a 6-month rolling average trend line. In the bottom-left subplot, create a multi-line chart comparing the TVL trends of the top 3 individual protocols (by peak TVL), with each line having different styles and colors. In the bottom-right subplot, create a combination chart with bars showing the number of active protocols per quarter and a line showing the average TVL per protocol over the same time periods. Include proper legends, axis labels, and a main title for the entire figure.
