    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart's primary flaws are in data representation and task compliance, not in its aesthetic formatting. Here are the critical improvements needed:\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Chart Type and Data Correction:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the current stacked bar chart with the required **stacked area chart** to properly visualize the continuous evolution of TVL over time.\n    *   **Data Integrity:** The y-axis scale of `1e31` is a critical error and must be corrected. The data needs to be plotted on a scale that accurately reflects 'Billions USD' as stated in the axis label. The chart should display a continuous trend across the 2018-2022 period, not a single anomalous spike.\n2.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Axis Scale Correction:**\n    *   **Secondary Y-Axis:** The scientific notation `1e30` at the top of the plot is incorrect and conflicts with the axis label 'Average TVL per Protocol (Millions USD)'. This axis must be rescaled to accurately represent the data in millions. For example, the ticks should be labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., corresponding to millions of USD.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Line Style Refinement:**\n    *   **Line Differentiation:** The line styles for 'QuipuSwap' (dashed and dash-dot) are very similar. To improve clarity, use more distinct styles, such as one solid, one dashed, and one dotted line.\n4.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Visual Emphasis:**\n    *   **Trend Line:** To make the '6-Month Rolling Average' trend line stand out more against the volatile 'Monthly Growth Rate' line, consider increasing its line width slightly (e.g., from 2pt to 3pt)."
