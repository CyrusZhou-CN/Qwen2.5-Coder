    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements, but focusing on the existing visual structure, the following improvements are critical:\n\n1.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   The primary issue is the overlapping main title. Use a function like `plt.suptitle()` or `fig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])` to allocate space for the main title above the subplots, preventing any overlap.\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between rows (`hspace` in `subplots_adjust`) to give each subplot more breathing room.\n\n2.  **Text Formatting:**\n    *   Remove the markdown-style asterisks from all titles. Format titles using font properties (e.g., `fontweight='bold'`).\n    *   Establish a clear typographic hierarchy: make the main title the largest and boldest (e.g., 16pt), followed by subplot titles (e.g., 12pt, bold), and then axis labels (e.g., 10pt).\n    *   Correct the x-axis on subplot (0, 2). The date range should be relevant to DeFi (e.g., 2019-2020), not starting in 1970.\n    *   In subplot (1, 2), increase the figure width or decrease the font size for the x-axis labels ('WBTC', 'Harvest Finance') to prevent them from overlapping.\n    *   In subplot (2, 2), use annotation tools to place the 'WBTC' and 'Harvest Finance' labels more effectively, for instance, with a small offset and a thin line pointing to the data point, instead of rotating the text.\n\n3.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), replace the clashing red and green bars. Use a more harmonious palette. For example, use a single color with varying opacity or two more muted, complementary colors to represent the data without causing eye strain.\n\n4.  **Chart Implementation (To meet task requirements):**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Is empty and must be created from scratch with the specified line chart, scatter overlay, and secondary axis bar chart.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** The bar chart must be replaced with a proper candlestick chart to show price movements.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** The chart is missing the required marginal histograms on the x and y axes and the time-based lines connecting the data points.\n    *   All other subplots must be revised to include the multiple layers and specific chart types as detailed in the prompt."
