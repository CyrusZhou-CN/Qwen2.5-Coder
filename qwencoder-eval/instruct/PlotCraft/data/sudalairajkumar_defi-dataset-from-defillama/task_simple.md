## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of Total Value Locked (TVL) over time for the top 3 DeFi protocols by maximum TVL. Filter the data to show only TVL records (Type == 'TVL'), identify the top 3 protocols by their peak TVL values, and plot their TVL trends from 2020 onwards using different colored lines with markers. Include a legend, proper axis labels, and a title that clearly indicates this is tracking DeFi protocol growth over time.
