## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of DeFi protocols over time. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2019-2020 Early DeFi Era): 
- Subplot 1: Line chart showing TVL growth for top 3 protocols with overlaid scatter points marking major milestones, plus a secondary y-axis bar chart showing daily volatility
- Subplot 2: Stacked area chart of TVL by category with overlaid line showing total market TVL, plus error bands indicating uncertainty ranges
- Subplot 3: Multi-line chart of chain dominance over time with filled areas between lines, plus histogram overlay showing distribution of daily changes

Middle row (2020-2021 DeFi Boom):
- Subplot 4: Dual-axis visualization with TVL line charts for major protocols on primary axis and token price movements as candlestick charts on secondary axis
- Subplot 5: Time series decomposition showing TVL trend, seasonal patterns, and residuals as separate layered components with different chart types (line + bar + scatter)
- Subplot 6: Cross-correlation heatmap overlaid on time series showing how different protocols influence each other, with correlation strength as background color intensity

Bottom row (2021-2022 Market Maturation):
- Subplot 7: Multi-protocol comparison using parallel coordinates for TVL metrics, overlaid with time-based color gradient and trend arrows
- Subplot 8: Bubble chart animation over time showing protocol size (TVL) vs growth rate, with bubble trails showing historical paths
- Subplot 9: Risk-return scatter plot with protocols as points, connected by time-based lines, overlaid with density contours and marginal distribution histograms

Each subplot must combine at least 3 different visualization elements and use different color schemes to distinguish time periods and data categories.
