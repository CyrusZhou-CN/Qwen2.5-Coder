# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing temporal patterns in Bangladesh's English news landscape. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Publisher Activity Analysis):
- Subplot 1: Combine a line chart showing daily news collection counts over time with a bar chart overlay showing cumulative articles per publisher, using dual y-axes
- Subplot 2: Create a stacked area chart showing the proportion of news articles by each publisher over time, overlaid with scatter points indicating peak collection days

Middle row (Content Temporal Dynamics):
- Subplot 3: Display a time series line chart of article title length (character count) trends over collection dates, combined with a violin plot showing the distribution of title lengths for each active publisher
- Subplot 4: Combine a calendar heatmap showing news collection intensity by day with marginal histograms showing hourly distribution patterns of news collection times

Bottom row (Publication Patterns):
- Subplot 5: Create a slope chart connecting publish dates to collection dates for articles where both are available, overlaid with error bars showing the average delay between publication and collection by publisher
- Subplot 6: Combine a time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of daily news volume with a correlation heatmap showing relationships between publishers' daily output patterns

Use consistent color schemes across subplots, ensure proper datetime handling for all temporal variables, and include appropriate legends and annotations explaining the temporal insights revealed.
