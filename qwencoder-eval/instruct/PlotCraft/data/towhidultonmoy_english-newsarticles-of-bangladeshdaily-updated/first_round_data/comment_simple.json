    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is entirely incorrect and does not address the user's prompt. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. To meet the requirements, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Chart Type:** Create a single pie chart, not a bar or line chart.\n2.  **Data Representation:** The pie chart should represent the percentage distribution of news articles for the four specified publishers (`thedailystar`, `thefinancialexpress`, `newagebd`, `daily-sun`). Each slice should correspond to one publisher, with its size proportional to its percentage of the total articles.\n3.  **Labels and Title:**\n    *   Set the chart title to 'Distribution of News Articles by Publisher'.\n    *   Label each pie slice directly with the publisher's name and its calculated percentage (e.g., 'thedailystar\\n35%').\n4.  **Color Scheme:** Use a professional and clear color palette. Avoid the current neon colors and dark background. A standard palette with distinct, muted colors (e.g., blues, greens, oranges) on a white background would be appropriate.\n5.  **Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for the entire chart.\n    *   Remove all axes and gridlines, as they are not used in a standard pie chart.\n    *   Use black or dark gray text for all labels and the title to ensure high readability.\n    *   To emphasize the largest contributor as requested, consider using the 'explode' property to slightly offset the largest slice from the center of the pie."
