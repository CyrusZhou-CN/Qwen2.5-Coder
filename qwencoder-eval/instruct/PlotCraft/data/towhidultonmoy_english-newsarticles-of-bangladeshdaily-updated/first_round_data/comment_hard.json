    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Layout and Titles:**\n    *   **Global Title:** Set a single, clear main title for the entire figure (e.g., \"Temporal Patterns in Bangladesh's English News Landscape\") using `fig.suptitle()`. Ensure it is positioned above all subplots without overlap.\n    *   **Subplot Titles:** Give each subplot its own distinct and concise title (e.g., 'Daily News Volume with 7-Day Rolling Average' for subplot (0,0)). Remove the current overlapping titles.\n    *   **Spacing:** Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)` to automatically adjust spacing and prevent titles and labels from overlapping.\n\n2.  **Subplot-Specific Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:** This subplot is incomplete. You must add the primary visualization: a bar chart on the primary y-axis representing the 'Daily News Count'. The existing red line for the 'Rolling Average' should be overlaid on a secondary y-axis.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** This subplot uses the wrong chart type. Replace the current line plots with a stacked area chart (`ax.stackplot`) to correctly visualize the cumulative contribution of each publisher over time. The 'Diversity Index' line can remain, preferably on a secondary y-axis for clarity.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:** This subplot needs to be completely rebuilt. The current visualization is not a calendar heatmap. Implement a proper calendar heatmap where each cell is a day of the year, colored by news intensity. Add two marginal plots: a bar chart on the right showing distribution by day of the week, and a histogram on the bottom showing distribution by hour of the day.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** The overlapping y-axis labels ('thedailystar', 'daily-sun') must be fixed. Increase the figure's height to create more vertical space, or use annotations with arrows to label the lines if they remain too close to each other.\n\n3.  **Visual and Aesthetic Enhancements:**\n    *   **Color Palette:** Choose a more saturated color palette for the publishers to ensure that lines, scatter points, and error bars are clearly visible against the background and gridlines.\n    *   **Professional Formatting:** Set the chart background to white (`facecolor='white'`). Ensure the main title is bolded and has a larger font size than subplot titles to establish a clear visual hierarchy. Make sure gridlines are subtle (light gray, thin) so they don't distract from the data."
