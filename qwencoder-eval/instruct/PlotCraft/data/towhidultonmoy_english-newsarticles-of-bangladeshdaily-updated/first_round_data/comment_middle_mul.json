    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart's quality and compliance, the following specific adjustments are recommended:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Complete Redesign:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the current single area chart with a `stacked area chart` to show how the proportion of coverage from each publisher contributes to the total over time.\n    *   **Data Representation:** The y-axis should represent cumulative proportion, summing to 1.0 (or 100%) for any given date.\n    *   **Missing Elements:** Add the required `individual publisher trend lines` (e.g., semi-transparent lines) overlaid on the stacked areas to highlight each publisher's specific trend.\n\n2.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Add Comparative Data:**\n    *   **Data Inclusion:** The plot must include the article length distributions for all publishers mentioned in the dashboard (e.g., 'thedailystar' and 'thefinancialexpress') to fulfill the requirement of showing patterns 'across different news sources'.\n    *   **Visualization:** Overlay the KDE curves for each publisher using distinct colors and update the legend accordingly. The histogram could be shown for the primary publisher or overlaid with transparency for all.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Improve Readability:**\n    *   **Bar Visibility:** The vertical lines representing daily counts are too thin. They should be rendered as bars with a discernible width to be visible.\n    *   **Data Sparsity:** Given the sparse data, consider adding markers (e.g., small dots) at the top of each bar to make non-zero days more prominent.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Enhance Color Scheme:**\n    *   **Heatmap Palette:** Replace the jarring yellow-and-maroon color map with a more perceptually uniform and subtle sequential palette, such as 'viridis', 'cividis', or 'Blues', to improve visual comfort and professionalism.\n\n5.  **Overall Formatting and Hierarchy:**\n    *   **Title Hierarchy:** Reduce the font size of the main title slightly and change the subplot titles to a regular (non-bold) font weight to create a clearer visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Color Cohesion:** Select a unified color palette to be used across all subplots to create a more cohesive and professional-looking dashboard. For example, use the same distinct color for 'thedailystar' in subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1)."
