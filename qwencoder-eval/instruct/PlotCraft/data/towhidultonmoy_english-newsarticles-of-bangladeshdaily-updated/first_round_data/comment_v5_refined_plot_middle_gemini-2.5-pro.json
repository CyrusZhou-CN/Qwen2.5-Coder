    "improvement_suggestions": "1.  **Correct Chart Types and Data Representation:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the current stacked bar chart with the required **stacked area chart**. The x-axis should represent the full time period, and the y-axis should show the cumulative proportion from 0 to 1, illustrating how each publisher's share of the total articles evolves over time.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** The data visualization is flawed. The y-axis must be corrected to show the actual **daily article counts**, not binary (0/1) values. This will make the trend line meaningful.\n\n2.  **Ensure Visual Consistency:**\n    *   **Background Color:** Change the background color of the heatmap in subplot (1, 1) from pale yellow to **white** to match the other three subplots for a cohesive and professional appearance.\n\n3.  **Improve Text and Annotations:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Add the missing numerical value labels on top of the bars for 'daily-sun' and 'thefinancialexpress' to ensure complete data presentation.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** After correcting the chart type, update the title to accurately reflect that it is a 'Cumulative Proportion Stacked Area Chart'.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** The annotation box is very bright. Consider a more subtle design, such as using a light gray background (`facecolor='whitesmoke'`) or removing the box entirely and using an arrow to point to the peak cell.\n\n4.  **Enhance Color Palette:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** The bar colors are disparate. For a more professional look, use a single color with varying shades or a curated, harmonious color palette instead of four unrelated colors.\n    *   **Consistency:** If the same publishers appear in multiple charts (e.g., (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)), use the **same color** for the same publisher across all subplots to improve readability and connection between the visualizations."
