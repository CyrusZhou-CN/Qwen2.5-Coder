## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis dashboard showing how news coverage patterns have evolved across different Bangladeshi English newspapers. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: A line chart overlaid with a bar chart showing daily article counts per publisher with a 7-day rolling average trend line, (2) Top-right: A stacked area chart showing the cumulative proportion of news coverage by each publisher over time with individual publisher trend lines, (3) Bottom-left: A heatmap showing hourly news collection patterns by publisher with overlaid scatter points indicating peak collection times, and (4) Bottom-right: A dual-axis plot combining a histogram of article lengths (word count) by publisher with kernel density estimation curves showing the distribution patterns of content depth across different news sources.
