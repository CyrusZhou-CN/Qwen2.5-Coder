# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive distribution analysis visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left subplot, create a histogram with overlaid KDE curve for col_67 (the only float column with high variability). In the top-right subplot, create a box plot comparing the distributions of col_1, col_38, col_49, and col_54 (the four columns with highest unique value counts). In the bottom-left subplot, create a violin plot for col_111 grouped by different ranges of col_67 values (split col_67 into quartiles). In the bottom-right subplot, create a combined histogram and KDE plot showing the distribution of col_68 with different colors for high vs low values of col_69 (split at median). Each subplot should include appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends to clearly communicate the distribution patterns in this fraud detection dataset.
