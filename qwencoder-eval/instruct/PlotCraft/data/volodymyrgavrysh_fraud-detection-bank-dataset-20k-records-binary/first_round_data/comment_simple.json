It must be discarded and created from scratch. \n\n1.  **Start Over:** The entire 2x2 dashboard concept should be abandoned. A new, single plot needs to be created.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a single (1x1) plot using a histogram to visualize the data distribution.\n3.  **Data and Bins:** The histogram must represent the 'transaction amounts' (col_67) and be configured with exactly 20 bins as specified in the prompt.\n4.  **Text Content:**\n    *   **Title:** Add a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Transaction Amounts'.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Label the x-axis as 'Transaction Amount' and the y-axis as 'Frequency' or 'Number of Transactions'.\n5.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Use a standard white background. The histogram bars should be a single, neutral color (e.g., steel blue or gray). All text should be black or dark gray.\n    *   **Typography:** The main title should be bold and have a larger font size than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Gridlines:** If used, gridlines should be subtle (light gray, thin) and appear behind the data bars.\n    *   **Remove Clutter:** All non-essential elements, such as the fictional watermarks ('DATA LEAK', 'CONFIDENTIAL') and nonsensical text, must be removed."
