    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure to follow the prompt and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps are required:\n1.  **Correct the Layout:** Change the grid from 2x2 to the specified 3x3 layout.\n2.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** Discard all current plots. Each of the nine subplot positions must be populated with the specific chart type and content requested in the prompt. For example:\n    *   Subplot (0, 0): Must be a histogram with an overlaid KDE curve, not a pie chart.\n    *   Subplot (0, 1): Must be a scatter plot with marginal histograms, not a bar chart.\n    *   Subplot (1, 0): Must be a correlation heatmap with a dendrogram, not a line/scatter plot.\n    *   This must be done for all nine specified subplots.\n3.  **Use Relevant Data and Text:** The entire visualization must be focused on 'Banking Fraud Detection Analysis'. All titles, axis labels, and legends must be changed to reflect this topic. Remove all nonsensical text like 'Flibber', 'Zorbak', and 'Weather Patterns in Mars'.\n4.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Change the background from black to white.\n    *   If gridlines are used, make them thin and light gray to be non-distracting.\n    *   Establish a clear text hierarchy: the main title ('Comprehensive Banking Fraud Detection Analysis Dashboard') should be bold and larger than the individual subplot titles.\n5.  **Improve Color Scheme:** Replace the harsh neon colors with a professional and harmonious color palette. Use colors meaningfully to differentiate data categories as specified in the prompt (e.g., coloring by feature type groups in subplot (0, 1)).\n6.  **Ensure Clarity:** Remove all overlapping text. Ensure there is sufficient white space between subplots and that all text elements are legible and do not interfere with the data."
