# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of anti-piracy legislation support across political parties and chambers. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot is a stacked bar chart displaying the distribution of stance categories (support, oppose, unknown) by political party, and the right plot is a pie chart showing the overall composition of legislators by chamber (House vs Senate). Use different colors for each stance category and ensure proper legends and titles for both subplots.
