## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing US legislators' positions on anti-piracy legislation across multiple dimensions. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Party Analysis
- Subplot 1: Combine a stacked bar chart showing stance distribution by party with an overlaid line plot showing average pro-piracy money by party
- Subplot 2: Create a scatter plot of pro vs con money colored by party, with marginal histograms showing the distribution of each money type
- Subplot 3: Combine a violin plot showing years of service distribution by party with overlaid box plots

Row 2: Chamber Analysis  
- Subplot 4: Create a grouped bar chart comparing average pro and con money by chamber, with error bars showing standard deviation
- Subplot 5: Combine a pie chart showing stance composition within each chamber using subplots side by side
- Subplot 6: Create a scatter plot of years vs total money (pro + con) colored by chamber, with trend lines for each chamber

Row 3: Cross-dimensional Analysis
- Subplot 7: Create a heatmap showing average pro money by party-chamber combinations, with annotated values
- Subplot 8: Combine a strip plot showing money ratio (pro/con) distribution by stance, overlaid with a box plot
- Subplot 9: Create a parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between years, pro money, con money, and stance (encoded numerically)

Each visualization should include proper titles, labels, legends, and use distinct color schemes to clearly differentiate groups and reveal clustering patterns in legislative behavior.
