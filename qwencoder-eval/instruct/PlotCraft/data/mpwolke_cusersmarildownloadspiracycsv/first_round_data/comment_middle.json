    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to address the user's prompt and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Correct Chart Types and Content:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the empty scatter plot with a stacked bar chart. The x-axis should represent 'Political Party', and the y-axis should show the count or percentage of legislators. Each bar should be segmented by 'stance' (support, oppose, unknown).\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the empty bar chart with a pie chart. The pie chart should be divided into two slices representing the proportion of legislators in the 'House' and the 'Senate'.\n2.  **Implement Correct Data Visualization:**\n    *   The data visualized must be the composition of stances on legislation, not financial data. The titles and axis labels must be updated to reflect this. For example, the title for subplot (0, 0) should be 'Stance on Anti-Piracy Legislation by Party', and for subplot (0, 1), it should be 'Legislator Composition by Chamber'.\n3.  **Improve Color Scheme and Legends:**\n    *   For the stacked bar chart, use three distinct and easily distinguishable colors for the 'support', 'oppose', and 'unknown' categories (e.g., green, red, and gray). Create a clear legend for these categories.\n    *   For the pie chart, use two different colors for 'House' and 'Senate' and label the slices or provide a legend.\n4.  **Refine Formatting and Hierarchy:**\n    *   Change the main title to accurately reflect the chart's content, such as 'Composition of Support for Anti-Piracy Legislation'.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title larger and/or more heavily weighted than the subplot titles."
