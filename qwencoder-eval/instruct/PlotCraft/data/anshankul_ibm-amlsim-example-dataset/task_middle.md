# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization with two subplots arranged vertically (2x1 layout) to analyze deviations in transaction amounts between fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities. The top subplot should display a diverging bar chart showing the difference between average transaction amounts for fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions by alert type, with bars extending left for negative deviations and right for positive deviations from the overall mean. The bottom subplot should show a dumbbell plot comparing the range (minimum to maximum) of transaction amounts between alerts dataset (fraudulent) and transactions dataset (non-fraudulent), with connecting lines highlighting the gap between fraudulent and normal transaction amount ranges.
