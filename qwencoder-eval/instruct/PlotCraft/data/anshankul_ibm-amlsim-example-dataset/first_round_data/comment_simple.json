    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and cannot be salvaged. It must be completely redone from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the current 2x1 layout of a bar chart and pie chart with a single 1x1 histogram.\n2. **Data Representation:** The histogram's x-axis must represent the continuous variable 'TX_AMOUNT', and the y-axis must represent the 'Frequency' or 'Count' of transactions within each bin. The data should be divided into 20 bins as requested.\n3. **Text Content:** All text must be corrected. The main title should be 'Distribution of Transaction Amounts'. The x-axis should be labeled 'Transaction Amount (TX_AMOUNT)', and the y-axis should be labeled 'Frequency'. Remove all irrelevant text like 'Banana Distribution of Moonlight' and 'Glarbnok's Revenge'.\n4. **Formatting and Aesthetics:** Use a professional and clean visual style. This includes a white background, subtle gray gridlines, and a single, non-garish color for the histogram bars (e.g., steelblue or darkgray). Ensure there is adequate white space and no overlapping elements.\n5. **Remove Extraneous Elements:** The entire pie chart subplot (0, 1) should be removed as it was not requested and is irrelevant to the task."
