    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, the following changes are recommended:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top Chart:**\n    *   **Correct Y-Axis Labels:** The most critical issue is the y-axis. Replace the current unreadable numeric tick labels with the actual categorical names for the 'Alert Type'. The numeric values are represented by the bar lengths and should not be used as axis tick labels.\n    *   **Resolve Text Overlap:** Correcting the y-axis labels will automatically fix the overlap with the 'Alert Type' axis title.\n    *   **Adjust Proportions:** Reduce the vertical height of this subplot to make the bars thinner and the plot less sparse. This will improve the visual balance.\n\n2.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom Chart:**\n    *   **Implement Correct Dumbbell Plot:** The chart must be redrawn as a proper dumbbell plot. For the 'Fraudulent' category, plot two points representing its minimum and maximum transaction amounts and connect them with a line, mirroring the style used for the 'Non-Fraudulent' category.\n    *   **Remove Misleading Lines:** Eliminate the incorrect dashed line that connects the single 'Fraudulent' point to the maximum 'Non-Fraudulent' point. Connecting lines should only exist *within* a category to form the dumbbell.\n    *   **Standardize X-Axis Ticks:** Reformat the x-axis tick labels for consistency and readability. Avoid mixing standard numbers and scientific notation. For example, use labels like '0', '5M', '10M', '15M', '20M' to represent millions.\n    *   **Add Data Labels:** Ensure clear data labels are present for both the minimum and maximum points of both the 'Fraudulent' and 'Non-Fraudulent' dumbbells once the chart is corrected.\n\n3.  **Overall Formatting:**\n    *   **Consistent Typography:** Ensure that font sizes and styles for axis labels, tick labels, and data labels are consistent across both subplots to create a more cohesive and professional appearance."
