    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several changes are needed to address both task compliance and chart quality:\n\n1.  **Fix Title Overlap:** The most critical issue is the main title overlapping the subplot titles. Use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.suptitle()` with vertical adjustment (`y` parameter) to create adequate space between the main title and the first row of plots.\n\n2.  **Complete Missing Visualizations:**\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** The treemap must be modified to include the requested embedded bar charts showing fraud distribution within the 'fan_in' and 'cycle' categories.\n    *   **Subplot (2,1):** The cluster plot must use different marker shapes (e.g., circles vs. crosses) to represent the 'fraud status' dimension, as instructed.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** A dendrogram must be added alongside the heatmap to visualize the hierarchical clustering of accounts.\n    *   **Subplot (1,1):** The parallel coordinates plot needs to incorporate the 'fraud status' dimension, ideally by coloring the lines differently for 'Fraud' and 'Normal' accounts. Using a single light blue color makes the plot uninformative.\n\n3.  **Enhance Text and Labels:**\n    *   Make all subplot titles bold to improve the visual hierarchy and distinguish them from axis labels.\n    *   In subplot (1,2) and (2,2), increase the bottom margin to give the rotated x-axis labels more space and prevent them from feeling cramped.\n    *   In subplot (0,0), the implementation of the box plot is confusing. It should be clarified how it relates to the scatter data. A better approach would be to place two distinct box plots (one for Normal, one for Fraud) on the side of the scatter plot for a clearer comparison of distributions.\n\n4.  **Improve Readability:**\n    *   In the network graph (0,1), consider reducing the opacity of the edges (`alpha` parameter) to make the structure clearer, as it is currently very dense.\n    *   In the bubble chart (1,0), the smallest bubbles are nearly invisible. Set a minimum size for the bubbles to ensure all data points are visible."
