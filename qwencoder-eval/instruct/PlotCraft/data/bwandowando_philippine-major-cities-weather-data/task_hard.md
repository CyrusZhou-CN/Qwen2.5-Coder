## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of weather patterns across Philippine major cities throughout 2024. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Monthly temperature trends with overlaid precipitation patterns using dual-axis line charts with error bands showing variability across cities, (2) Seasonal humidity distribution patterns using violin plots overlaid with box plots for each quarter, (3) Wind speed and direction correlation analysis using polar scatter plots with density contours for each season.

Middle row: (4) Daily temperature amplitude (max-min difference) evolution using area charts with moving averages and seasonal decomposition overlays, (5) Pressure system changes using line charts with filled areas between high/low pressure periods and storm event markers, (6) Weather condition frequency heatmap combined with stacked area charts showing the proportion of different weather types over time.

Bottom row: (7) City-wise temperature anomaly patterns using diverging bar charts overlaid with trend lines showing deviation from annual means, (8) Precipitation intensity distribution using histogram-KDE combinations with seasonal color coding and extreme event annotations, (9) Multi-variable weather index correlation matrix heatmap combined with time series of composite weather scores showing seasonal clustering patterns.
