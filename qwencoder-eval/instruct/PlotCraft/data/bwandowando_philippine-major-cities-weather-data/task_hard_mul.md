# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing temporal weather patterns across Philippine major cities throughout 2024. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): Monthly temperature evolution analysis
- Subplot 1: Combine line plots showing average monthly temperature trends for 5 major cities (Manila, Cebu, Davao, Baguio, Iloilo) with error bars indicating temperature variability, overlaid with a heatmap background showing seasonal intensity
- Subplot 2: Create a dual-axis plot with monthly temperature ranges (min-max as area chart) for the hottest and coolest cities, combined with scatter points showing humidity correlation and trend lines
- Subplot 3: Display temperature distribution changes across seasons using violin plots for each quarter overlaid with box plots, and add seasonal average lines

Bottom row (3 subplots): Precipitation and atmospheric pressure patterns
- Subplot 4: Combine monthly precipitation bar charts for 3 representative cities from different regions with overlaid line plots showing atmospheric pressure trends, plus shaded areas indicating monsoon seasons
- Subplot 5: Create a correlation matrix heatmap of weather variables (temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation) for each quarter, combined with scatter plots in the diagonal showing seasonal clustering
- Subplot 6: Display wind speed and direction patterns using polar plots for each season, overlaid with precipitation intensity as color-coded scatter points and seasonal trend lines

Use data from at least 6 different monthly files to capture the full year's weather evolution, ensuring each composite subplot reveals both individual variable patterns and their interconnected relationships across time.
