    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul of the bottom row to be viable. \n1. **Critical Overlap Correction:** The most urgent issue is the overlap. Subplot (1,1) and subplot (1,2) must be rendered in their own separate axes within the 3x2 grid, not on top of each other. This is a fundamental layout error that needs to be fixed first.\n2. **Complete Subplot (1,1) - Correlation Matrix:**\n   - Fulfill the requirement for scatter plots on the diagonal of the correlation matrix to show seasonal clustering.\n   - The prompt asks for a matrix for *each* quarter. The current implementation only shows Q1 and Q2. This should be expanded to include all four quarters. A good approach would be to create four smaller heatmaps within the subplot (1,1) axes, arranged in a 2x2 pattern.\n3. **Redesign Subplot (1,2) - Polar Plots:**\n   - The prompt requires *polar plots for each season*. Instead of one cluttered polar plot, create four distinct, smaller polar plots within the subplot (1,2) axes, each clearly labeled for its respective season (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).\n   - Ensure the precipitation intensity is clearly visualized as color-coded scatter points as requested.\n4. **Improve Layout and Spacing:**\n   - Increase the `hspace` and `wspace` between subplots to give titles, labels, and plots more room to breathe and prevent them from feeling cramped.\n   - The overall figure size should be increased to accommodate the density of information without sacrificing clarity.\n5. **Enhance Legends and Titles:**\n   - In subplot (1,0), the two separate legends are redundant and create clutter. Combine them into a single, unified legend.\n   - Shorten the title of subplot (1,2) to something more concise, like 'Seasonal Wind Patterns'. The detailed description can be moved to a caption if needed.\n6. **Refine Text Elements:**\n   - Ensure all axis labels, especially on the correlation matrix, are fully visible and not truncated.\n   - In subplot (0,1), the legend should be clarified to explicitly link the colors to the area charts (temperature ranges) and the scatter/trendline plots (humidity)."
