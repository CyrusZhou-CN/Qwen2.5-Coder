# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing corruption patterns across departments in India. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a diverging bar chart showing how each department's average bribe amount deviates from the overall mean bribe amount (with bars extending left for below-average and right for above-average amounts), and the right plot shows a lollipop chart ranking departments by their total number of corruption cases reported. Use different colors to highlight departments that are both high in average bribe amount and high in case frequency.
