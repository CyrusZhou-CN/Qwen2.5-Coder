Here is a guide to creating the correct chart:\n1.  **Chart Type:** Replace the pie chart and scatter plot with a single horizontal bar chart.\n2.  **Data and Axes:**\n    *   The y-axis should list the names of the 'Top 10 Departments'.\n    *   The x-axis should represent the 'Total Bribe Amount (in INR)'.\n3.  **Sorting:** The bars must be sorted in descending order, with the department that has the highest bribe amount positioned at the top of the chart.\n4.  **Title and Labels:**\n    *   Set a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Top 10 Departments by Total Bribe Amount'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Total Bribe Amount (INR)'.\n    *   Label the y-axis as 'Department'.\n    *   Consider adding data labels at the end of each bar to show the exact bribe amount. These labels should be formatted with comma separators as requested (e.g., '1,500,000').\n5.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    *   Use a professional and clean aesthetic: a white background with dark gray or black text is standard.\n    *   Make the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (like a medium gray or blue) for all bars to focus attention on the ranking by length.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and thin so they don't distract from the data bars."
