    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the following changes are recommended:\n\n1.  **Title Correction:** The most critical issue is the title. Create a single, clear main title for the entire figure (e.g., 'Corruption Patterns in Indian Government Departments') and place it centered above the two subplots. Then, give each subplot its own distinct title below the main one. For subplot (0, 0): 'Deviation from Mean Bribe Amount'. For subplot (0, 1): 'Total Corruption Cases Reported'.\n\n2.  **Chart Type Correction (Subplot 0,0):** Re-implement the left chart as a true diverging bar chart. The y-axis should represent the departments, and the x-axis should be centered at zero. Bars for departments with above-average bribe amounts should extend to the right (positive deviation), and bars for those with below-average amounts should extend to the left (negative deviation).\n\n3.  **Data and Coloring Consistency:** Ensure both subplots display data for the same set of departments to enable a valid comparison. The red 'High Risk' color must be applied consistently to the *same departments* in both subplot (0, 0) and subplot (0, 1) to fulfill the core task requirement.\n\n4.  **Legend Simplification:** Create a single, unified legend for the entire figure. It should be simplified to define the two colors used, for example: 'Red: High Risk (High Bribe & High Cases)' and 'Blue: Other'. Remove the entry for the unused light blue color and the confusing 'Above/Below Average' labels, as the diverging chart's direction will convey that information implicitly.\n\n5.  **Layout and Spacing:** Add more vertical whitespace between the main title and the subplots to prevent any overlap. Ensure the legend at the bottom is neatly aligned and has adequate padding."
