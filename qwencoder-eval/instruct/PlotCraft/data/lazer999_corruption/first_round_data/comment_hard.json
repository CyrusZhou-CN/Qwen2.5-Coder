    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, focus on task compliance, layout, and text clarity. \n1. **Task Compliance:** \n   - In subplot (0, 1), replace the box plot with the requested violin plot, and overlay the box plot on top of it. \n   - In subplot (1, 0), change the grouped bar chart to a stacked bar chart to meet the prompt's requirement. \n2. **Layout and Spacing:** \n   - Increase the overall figure size to give each subplot more room. \n   - Adjust subplot spacing to prevent overlap between titles and axes of adjacent plots (e.g., using `fig.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `subplots_adjust`). \n3. **Text and Labels:** \n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** This is the most critical issue. Fix the unreadable x-axis date labels by plotting fewer ticks (e.g., one label per year) or by significantly increasing the width of this specific subplot. \n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** Resolve the title overlap by integrating the secondary axis information into the main title (e.g., 'Department Bribery Totals and Average Views per Complaint'). \n   - **General Labels:** For plots with long categorical labels (e.g., (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)), increase the bottom margin to prevent truncation and avoid excessive rotation. For subplot (0, 0), increase the left margin to show the full department names. Increase the base font size for all text for better legibility. \n4. **Visual Elements:** \n   - **Subplot (2, 2):** The parallel coordinates plot is visually cluttered. To make it interpretable, apply a high transparency (`alpha`) to all lines and then highlight a few key lines (e.g., for a specific location) with a solid, bright color. Add a legend to explain what is being highlighted. \n5. **Professional Formatting:** \n   - Add a main, overarching title for the entire 3x3 grid (e.g., 'Comprehensive Analysis of Corruption Data'). \n   - For a cleaner aesthetic, remove the top and right spines from each subplot (`ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)`, `ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)`)."
