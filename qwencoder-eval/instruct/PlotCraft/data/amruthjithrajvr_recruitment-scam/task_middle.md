Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive distribution analysis of recruitment scam patterns using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left subplot, create a histogram with overlaid KDE curve showing the distribution of job postings across different industries, with separate colors for fraudulent vs legitimate postings. In the top-right subplot, combine a violin plot with strip plot overlay to show the distribution of required experience levels for both fraudulent and legitimate job postings. In the bottom-left subplot, create a stacked histogram showing the distribution of employment types, with each bar split between fraudulent and legitimate postings. In the bottom-right subplot, combine a box plot with jittered scatter points to display the distribution of job postings across different functions/departments, comparing fraudulent vs legitimate patterns. Use consistent color coding throughout all subplots to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate job postings.
