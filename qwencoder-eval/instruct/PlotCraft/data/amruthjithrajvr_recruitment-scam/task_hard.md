## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing recruitment scam patterns across different job characteristics. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top row: (1) A scatter plot with density contours showing the relationship between required experience levels and education levels, with point colors indicating fraudulent vs legitimate jobs, overlaid with marginal box plots. (2) A grouped violin plot comparing salary range distributions between fraudulent and legitimate jobs, with embedded box plots and individual data points. (3) A stacked bar chart showing employment type composition by fraud status, with percentage annotations and a secondary line plot showing fraud rates.

Middle row: (4) A hierarchical cluster heatmap displaying correlation patterns between categorical variables (telecommuting, has_company_logo, has_questions, employment_type) with fraud indicators, including dendrograms. (5) A parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between industry, function, required_experience, and fraud status, with color-coded paths and transparency based on density. (6) A network graph visualization showing connections between departments and industries, with node sizes representing job counts and edge weights showing fraud correlation strength.

Bottom row: (7) A treemap showing the hierarchical breakdown of jobs by industry and function, with color intensity representing fraud rates and size representing job volume. (8) A radar chart comparing the profile characteristics (has_logo, has_questions, telecommuting, etc.) between fraudulent and legitimate job clusters, with filled areas and confidence intervals. (9) A bubble chart plotting industry vs function with bubble sizes representing job counts, colors indicating average fraud rates, and shape variations for different employment types, overlaid with trend lines.
