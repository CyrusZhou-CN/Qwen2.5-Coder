    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart's quality and clarity, the following improvements are recommended:\n1.  **Title Correction:** Correct the spacing in the title from 'Composition of Job PostingsbyEmployment Type' to 'Composition of Job Postings by Employment Type'. Make the title bold to establish a stronger visual hierarchy.\n2.  **Label Clarity:** The current labeling is ambiguous and crowded. Implement one of the following solutions:\n    *   **Use a Legend:** Remove the labels from around the pie and add a clear legend that associates each color with an employment type and its percentage.\n    *   **Use Callout Lines:** For the smaller slices ('Temporary' and 'Other'), use leader lines to connect the text labels directly to their corresponding pie segments. This will eliminate crowding and ambiguity.\n3.  **Label Placement:** Ensure the 'Part-time' label clearly corresponds to the yellow slice (10.6%). Reposition it to remove any doubt.\n4.  **Highlighting:** To more explicitly fulfill the 'highlight' requirement, consider 'exploding' the 'Full-time' slice slightly by pulling it away from the center. This is a standard technique to draw attention to the most significant segment.\n5.  **Label Consistency:** For a cleaner look, make the labeling style consistent. For example, place all category names outside the pie and all percentage values inside, or combine them into a single label (e.g., 'Full-time\\n80.6%') and place them consistently."
