    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to regenerate the entire grid to comply with the task prompt, using the correct chart types and features for each subplot. Beyond that, to improve the current chart's quality:\n\n1.  **Element Positioning and Spacing:** Increase the vertical spacing between subplot rows to prevent titles from crowding the plots above them. In subplot (1,2), use a force-directed layout algorithm to reposition network nodes and eliminate label overlap. In subplot (2,0), increase the left margin to provide enough space for the full y-axis labels.\n2.  **Text Formatting Improvements:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making all subplot titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels. Add the missing y-axis label 'Salary' to subplot (0,1). Correct the misleading title of subplot (2,0) to 'Industry Job Volume'. Rotate the x-axis labels in subplot (1,0) by 90 degrees or reduce font size to prevent overlap.\n3.  **Data Representation:** In subplot (0,1), apply a logarithmic scale to the y-axis or cap the axis range to handle extreme outliers, making the box plot distributions visible.\n4.  **Color Scheme Enhancements:** In subplot (2,0), replace the very light orange color with a more saturated color that has better contrast against the white background.\n5.  **Annotation and Legend Optimizations:** Ensure all legends are clearly positioned and do not obstruct data, as seen in the well-placed legends in (0,0) and (2,1)."
