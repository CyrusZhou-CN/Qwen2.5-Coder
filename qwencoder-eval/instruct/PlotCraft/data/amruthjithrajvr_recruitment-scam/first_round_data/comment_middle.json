    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revisions, primarily focused on the bottom-right subplot and overall readability.\n\n1.  **Correct Subplot (1,1) Content:**\n    *   Redo the subplot at (1,1) entirely. It should display the distribution (i.e., counts) of job postings across different functions. A grouped bar chart would be effective for comparing fraudulent vs. legitimate counts side-by-side for each function.\n    *   The y-axis for this subplot should be 'Count of Job Postings', not 'salary_range'.\n    *   Apply the same color coding as the other plots (e.g., blue for 'Legitimate'/'False', orange for 'Fraudulent'/'True') to ensure consistency.\n\n2.  **Address Text Overlap and Readability:**\n    *   For the corrected subplot (1,1), there are too many 'function' categories to display clearly on the x-axis. Either create a horizontal bar chart to provide more space for labels, or group the less frequent functions into an 'Other' category and display only the top 10-15.\n    *   If a vertical bar chart is retained for subplot (1,1), rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees (`plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`) to prevent overlap.\n\n3.  **Improve Labels and Titles:**\n    *   Add a descriptive x-axis label to subplot (0,0), such as 'Number of Postings per Industry'.\n    *   Make all axis labels more descriptive (e.g., change 'fraudulent' to 'Fraudulent Status', 'required_experience' to 'Required Experience Level').\n    *   Make all subplot titles bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy.\n    *   Add an overall figure title (e.g., using `fig.suptitle()`) like 'Analysis of Fraudulent Job Posting Characteristics'.\n\n4.  **Enhance Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the overall figure size (`figsize`) to give each plot more breathing room.\n    *   Adjust the spacing between subplots using `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.4)` to prevent titles and labels from running into adjacent plots.\n\n5.  **Data Transformation for Clarity:**\n    *   In subplot (0,0), the data is highly skewed to the left. Consider applying a log scale to the x-axis (`ax.set_xscale('log')`) to make the distribution in the tail more visible."
