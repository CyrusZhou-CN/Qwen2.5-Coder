    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete and requires a complete overhaul. Here are the necessary steps:\n1. **Plot the Data:** The most critical issue is the absence of data. A horizontal bar chart must be generated by plotting the gender wage gap values for the top 10 countries.\n2. **Correct the Y-Axis:** Replace the numerical y-axis ticks with the names of the top 10 countries. The axis label 'Country' is correct, but the ticks must correspond to it.\n3. **Order the Bars:** Arrange the horizontal bars in descending order, with the country having the highest wage gap at the top and the 10th highest at the bottom, to fulfill the ranking requirement.\n4. **Refine the Title:** Make the title more informative by replacing '(time)' with the specific year the data represents (e.g., 'Top 10 Countries with the Highest Gender Wage Gaps in 2022'). Bolding the title would also improve the visual hierarchy.\n5. **Add Data Labels:** For enhanced clarity, add data labels at the end of each bar to show the precise percentage value of the wage gap.\n6. **Adjust Axis Limits:** The x-axis range should be set appropriately to frame the data, ensuring the variation between bars is clear without excessive white space."
