    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete regeneration as it fails to meet the fundamental requirements of the prompt. The following are specific corrections needed:\n\n1.  **Data and Chart Type Implementation:**\n    *   **Row 1 (Subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)):** Must be completely redrawn to include the specified line charts for trends, filled area charts for variation, and scatter points for policy changes. The current vertical lines are incorrect.\n    *   **Row 2 (Subplots (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)):** Must be redrawn to use step plots instead of filled areas. A secondary y-axis with a bar chart for absolute values needs to be added, along with trend lines and confidence intervals.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** The background should be a proper heatmap with varying intensity by decade, not a single uniform color.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** The markers must be changed from simple dots to bubbles where size represents the magnitude of change. The severe y-axis label overlap must be fixed, possibly by adjusting label positions or using annotations with arrows.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** The requested thin connecting lines showing individual country trajectories must be added. The stray horizontal line artifacts should be removed.\n\n2.  **Text Formatting Improvements:**\n    *   **Titles:** Remove the markdown asterisks from all subplot titles (e.g., change '**DEU - Wage Gap Evolution**' to 'DEU - Wage Gap Evolution') and apply a bold font weight for a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Axis Labels and Ticks:** Correct all axes to be meaningful. The 'Year' axes in Row 2 should display integer years, not decimals or a 0-1 scale. Ensure all tick labels are legible and properly formatted.\n\n3.  **Layout and Clarity:**\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** The primary focus for layout improvement is resolving the unreadable, overlapping country labels on the y-axis. This is critical for the chart to be interpretable."
