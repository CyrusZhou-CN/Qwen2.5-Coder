    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to adhere to the task prompt. The chart must be completely redesigned to meet the requirements.\n1. **Layout and Content:** Re-create the visualization using the specified 2x1 subplot layout. The top subplot, at position (0, 0), must contain line charts showing the wage gap evolution for the top 5 countries. The bottom subplot, at position (1, 0), should contain the area chart of the global average wage gap, as partially implemented here.\n2. **Titles and Labels:** Add a main, bolded title for the entire figure (e.g., 'Gender Wage Gap Evolution: Global and National Trends'). Also, provide distinct, bolded titles for each subplot to clarify their content (e.g., 'Top 5 Countries with Highest Average Wage Gap' for subplot (0, 0) and 'Global Average Wage Gap Trend (1975-Present)' for subplot (1, 0)).\n3. **Data Presentation:** The current area chart shows disconnected segments due to gaps in the data, which is visually jarring. Consider if it's more appropriate to connect the points with a line to show the trend, or if the data is too sparse, a bar chart might be a better choice to represent data for specific years.\n4. **Legend:** For the top subplot (0, 0), ensure there is a clear legend that maps each line color to its corresponding country.\n5. **Y-Axis Consistency:** To facilitate comparison, consider using a consistent y-axis scale for both subplots if the data ranges are comparable. If not, ensure each y-axis is clearly labeled."
