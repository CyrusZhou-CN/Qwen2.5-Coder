## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of gender wage gaps over time. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays line charts for the top 5 countries with the highest average wage gaps, and the bottom plot shows an area chart depicting the overall trend of global average wage gap from 1975 to the most recent year available. Parse the semicolon-delimited data appropriately, extract country codes, years, and wage gap values, then highlight significant trends and patterns in gender wage inequality across different nations and time periods.
