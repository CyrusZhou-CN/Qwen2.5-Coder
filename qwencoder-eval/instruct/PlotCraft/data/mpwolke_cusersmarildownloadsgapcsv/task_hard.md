# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of gender wage gaps across different countries and employment types over time. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Focus on top 3 countries with highest average wage gaps - each subplot should overlay a line chart showing temporal trends with a filled area chart showing the range of variation, plus scatter points highlighting significant policy change years.

Row 2: Focus on bottom 3 countries with lowest average wage gaps - each subplot should combine a step plot showing year-over-year changes with a secondary y-axis bar chart displaying the absolute gap values, and include trend lines with confidence intervals.

Row 3: Comparative analysis across employment types - Left subplot should show a multi-line time series with different line styles for employees vs self-employed overlaid with a heatmap-style background showing decade-wise intensity. Middle subplot should display a slope chart connecting start and end points for each country with bubble sizes representing the magnitude of change. Right subplot should combine a violin plot showing distribution of gaps by decade with box plots overlaid and individual country trajectories as thin connecting lines.
