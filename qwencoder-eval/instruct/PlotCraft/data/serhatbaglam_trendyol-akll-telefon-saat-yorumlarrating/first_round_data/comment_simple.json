    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the failure to display any data. The chart must be regenerated after successfully loading and processing the customer rating data from the specified files.\n1.  **Chart Type Correction**: Replace the current empty plot with a proper histogram. Use vertical bars to represent the frequency (Number of Reviews) for each rating category (1 Star, 2 Stars, etc.).\n2.  **Data Representation**: Ensure the heights of the histogram bars accurately reflect the count of reviews for each rating.\n3.  **Y-Axis Correction**: The y-axis scale and tick labels must be corrected to represent the frequency counts properly. The current repetitive '0' labels should be replaced with a meaningful numerical scale (e.g., 0, 500, 1000, etc.) based on the data range.\n4.  **Remove Erroneous Markers**: The five '0' markers currently plotted along the x-axis should be removed, as they are not a standard component of a histogram.\n5.  **Update Text Box**: After loading the data, recalculate the statistics and update the text box with the correct 'Total Reviews', 'Average Rating', and 'Median Rating'. Consider slightly reducing the font size within the box to make it less visually dominant.\n6.  **X-Axis Bins**: For a histogram of discrete integer ratings, ensure the bins are set up correctly to avoid ambiguity. For example, set bin edges at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 to center the bars over the integer values."
