    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet the complex chart type requirements; the chart must be regenerated to include the specified components (marginal histograms, bubble plots, overlaid box plots, etc.). For the existing visual, the following improvements are critical:\n\n1.  **Fix Title Overlap**: The most urgent issue is the overlapping titles. Use a figure-level super title (`fig.suptitle()`) for 'Comprehensive Brand Performance Analysis...' and place it at the top of the figure with a larger, bold font. Ensure there is adequate padding between this main title and the top row of subplots.\n\n2.  **Improve Layout Spacing**: Increase the vertical spacing between the rows of subplots using `subplots_adjust(hspace=...)` to reduce the cramped appearance and give each row more breathing room.\n\n3.  **Enhance Text Hierarchy**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title should be the largest and boldest. Subplot titles (e.g., 'Smartphone Correlation Matrix') should be smaller than the main title but larger than axis labels. Axis labels should be clear and legible.\n\n4.  **Refine Subplot (1,0) and (1,1) - Heatmaps**: The x-axis tick labels are missing for the rightmost column ('Rating Std'). Add these labels for completeness. Ensure the y-axis tick labels are vertically centered with their corresponding heatmap cells.\n\n5.  **Refine Subplot (2,0) and (2,1) - Violin Plots**: The rotated x-axis tick labels are slightly crowded. Consider a smaller font size or a different rotation angle (e.g., 30 degrees with `ha='right'`) to improve separation and readability."
