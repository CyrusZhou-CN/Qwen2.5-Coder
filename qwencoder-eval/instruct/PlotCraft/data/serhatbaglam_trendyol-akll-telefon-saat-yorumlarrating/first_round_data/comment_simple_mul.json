    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct the Sorting Order:** The most critical fix is to reorder the bars to be in descending order of average rating, as specified in the prompt. 'Huawei Watch' (4.90) should be at the top, and 'Samsung Watch' (4.74) should be at the bottom.\n2. **Implement Categorical Coloring:** Replace the current multi-color scheme with a two-color palette to distinguish between product types. For example, use one consistent color (e.g., steel blue) for all smartphone brands ('iPhone', 'Samsung Phone', 'Xiaomi Phone') and a second distinct color (e.g., teal) for all smartwatch brands ('Huawei Watch', 'Apple Watch', 'Samsung Watch'). Add a simple legend to clarify the color coding.\n3. **Improve Text Label Alignment:** Adjust the vertical alignment of the numerical rating labels (e.g., '4.90', '4.88'). They should be positioned in the vertical center of each bar for a cleaner and more professional appearance.\n4. **Establish Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title visually distinct from other text elements to create a clear hierarchy. Increase its font size and/or apply a bold weight.\n5. **Refine Layout Spacing:** Reduce the amount of empty white space above the top bar and below the bottom bar to make the chart more compact and visually balanced."
