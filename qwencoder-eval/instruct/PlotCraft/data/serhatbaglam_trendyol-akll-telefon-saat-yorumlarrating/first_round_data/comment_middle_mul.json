The primary suggestion is to follow the prompt's instructions precisely.\n\n1.  **Layout and Structure:**\n    *   Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid layout.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the pie chart with a scatter plot.\n    *   **Data:** Plot 'average ratings' on one axis and 'total review counts' on the other.\n    *   **Features:** Add regression lines to show the trend. Use distinct colors for 'smartphones' and 'smartwatches'.\n    *   **Text:** Use a relevant title like 'Correlation between Average Rating and Review Count'.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the bar chart with a correlation heatmap.\n    *   **Data:** The heatmap should show the correlation coefficients between 'ratings', 'review counts', and 'price ranges'.\n    *   **Formatting:** Use a diverging color palette (e.g., blue-white-red) to clearly distinguish positive and negative correlations. Annotate each cell with the correlation value.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Replace the tangled line chart with a bubble chart.\n    *   **Encoding:** Set the x-axis to 'average rating', y-axis to 'rating variance', bubble size to 'total review volume', and bubble color to 'product category'.\n    *   **Text:** Use a clear title like 'Brand Performance Analysis'.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Create the requested parallel coordinates plot.\n    *   **Data:** Each axis should represent a different metric (e.g., 'average rating', 'review count', 'product diversity'), and each line should represent a brand.\n\n6.  **General Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines for a clean, professional look.\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making titles larger and/or bold. Ensure all axis labels and legends are legible and correctly describe the data.\n    *   **Color:** Use a consistent, professional color palette across all four subplots."
