    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Implement the Missing Bar Chart**: The most critical omission is the bar chart. Add a bar chart on the secondary y-axis ('Total Review Count') to display the review volume for each brand. The bars should be aligned with the x-position of the corresponding brand's scatter point. Use a neutral color like light gray for the bars to avoid visual clutter.\n2. **Revise the X-Axis and Labeling Strategy**: The current x-axis labeling is the biggest visual flaw. Instead of using brand names as tick labels (which causes the overlap), the x-axis should be a standard numerical scale for 'Average Price (TL)'. Label each data point directly with its brand name, as has already been done for 'Apple', 'Xiaomi', 'Huawei', and 'Reeder'. This should be applied consistently to 'Samsung' and 'Mateo' to resolve the overlap and improve clarity.\n3. **Adjust Axis Limits**: Widen the x-axis limits to better distribute the data points and reduce the empty space on the right side of the plot, creating a more balanced composition.\n4. **Refine Text Box Style**: For a cleaner look, change the background of the text box in the bottom-right corner from light blue to white with a thin gray or black border to match the professional aesthetic of the rest of the chart.\n5. **Improve Legend Clarity**: The legend is good but could be slightly improved. Ensure the legend for point sizes ('500 reviews', etc.) clearly corresponds to the visual representation in the plot. The legend title 'Point size ∝ Review count' in the text box is good, but having visual examples in the main legend is better."
