Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis dashboard using a 2x2 subplot grid to examine the relationships between product ratings, review counts, and brand performance across smartphone and smartwatch categories. In the top-left subplot, create a scatter plot with regression lines showing the correlation between average ratings and total review counts for each brand, with different colors for smartphones vs smartwatches. In the top-right subplot, generate a correlation heatmap displaying the relationships between numerical variables (ratings, review counts, price ranges if available) across all brands. In the bottom-left subplot, create a bubble chart where bubble size represents total review volume, x-axis shows average rating, y-axis shows rating variance, and colors distinguish between product categories. In the bottom-right subplot, design a parallel coordinates plot to visualize multi-dimensional relationships between brands across rating metrics, review counts, and product diversity.
