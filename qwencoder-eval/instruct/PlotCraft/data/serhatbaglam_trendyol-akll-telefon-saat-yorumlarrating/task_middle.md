Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between product ratings and price across different brands in the Trendyol dataset. First, create a scatter plot showing the correlation between average rating and average price for each brand (smartphones and smartwatches combined), with point sizes representing the total number of reviews per brand. Then, overlay a regression line to show the overall trend. Additionally, create a secondary y-axis bar chart on the same plot showing the total review count for each brand to provide context for the reliability of each brand's average metrics.
