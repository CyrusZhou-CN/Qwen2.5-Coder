## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the relationship between product ratings and pricing across different smartphone and smartwatch brands from Trendyol. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining scatter plots with regression lines and marginal distribution plots (histograms or KDE curves). The nine subplots should represent: (1) iPhone price vs rating with marginal distributions, (2) Samsung phone price vs rating with marginal distributions, (3) Xiaomi phone price vs rating with marginal distributions, (4) Apple Watch price vs rating with marginal distributions, (5) Samsung Watch price vs rating with marginal distributions, (6) Huawei Watch price vs rating with marginal distributions, (7) Xiaomi Watch price vs rating with marginal distributions, (8) Mateo Watch price vs rating with marginal distributions, and (9) Reeder product price vs rating with marginal distributions. Each subplot should include correlation coefficients, trend lines, and color-coded density representations to reveal how pricing strategies correlate with customer satisfaction across different product categories and brands.
