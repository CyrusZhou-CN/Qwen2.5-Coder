# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the correlation patterns between product ratings, review counts, and brand performance across different product categories. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2x1): Create scatter plots with marginal histograms showing the relationship between average ratings and total review counts for each brand, with the left subplot focusing on smartphone data (iPhone, Samsung phones, Xiaomi phones, Reeder) and the right subplot on smartwatch data (Apple Watch, Samsung Watch, Huawei Watch, Mateo Watch, Xiaomi Watch). Overlay trend lines and add color-coding by brand.

Middle row (2x1): Design correlation heatmaps combined with bubble plots where bubble sizes represent review volumes. The left subplot should show correlation matrices between rating distributions, review counts, and brand market share for smartphones, while the right subplot displays the same analysis for smartwatches.

Bottom row (2x1): Construct dual-axis plots combining violin plots (showing rating distributions) with overlaid box plots (showing quartile information) and scatter points (representing individual product performance outliers). The left subplot should compare rating variance across smartphone brands, and the right subplot should analyze smartwatch brands. Include statistical significance indicators and confidence intervals.
