    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the incorrect and incomplete data representation. The following improvements are critical:\n1.  **Data Correction**: The dataset must be processed correctly to include both 'Survivors' and 'Non-Survivors' in both plots.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Pie Chart**: This chart must be completely redrawn to show two slices representing the correct proportions of 'Survivors' and 'Non-Survivors'. Apply the distinct colors (e.g., green for survivors, red for non-survivors) to each slice and label them accordingly.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Bar Chart**: Convert this from a simple bar chart to a stacked bar chart as requested. Each bar should have two segments: a red segment for the count of 'Non-Survivors' and a green segment for the count of 'Survivors' within that Passenger ID range. The y-axis should represent the total count.\n4.  **Text and Labels**: Remove the current data labels (e.g., '105') from the bars, as they will be confusing in a stacked format. The legend is appropriate for a stacked chart, but it must correspond to the data actually being displayed.\n5.  **Layout and Formatting**: For a more professional appearance, vertically align the main titles of the two subplots ('Overall Survival Composition' and 'Survival Counts by Passenger ID Ranges'). Remove the shadow effect from the legend box in subplot (0, 1) to create a flatter, cleaner design."
