## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the survival composition of Titanic passengers. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a pie chart showing the proportion of survivors vs non-survivors, and the right plot shows a stacked bar chart breaking down survival counts by passenger ID ranges (create 4 equal bins based on PassengerId ranges). Add appropriate titles, labels, and a color scheme that clearly distinguishes between survival categories.
