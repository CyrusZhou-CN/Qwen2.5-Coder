Deviation

## Instruction
Create a 3x3 grid of composite visualizations analyzing the deviation patterns in Titanic passenger survival predictions. Each subplot should combine multiple chart types to show different aspects of deviation from expected survival patterns. Top row: (1) Diverging bar chart with error bars showing PassengerId ranges vs survival rate deviations from 50% baseline, overlaid with a line plot of cumulative deviation trends, (2) Dumbbell plot comparing actual vs expected survival rates across passenger ID quartiles with scatter points showing individual passenger deviations, (3) Area chart showing deviation magnitude distribution with overlaid violin plot of deviation densities. Middle row: (4) Radar chart displaying deviation metrics across multiple dimensions (early vs late passengers, ID clustering patterns) with overlaid polar scatter plot, (5) Slope chart connecting baseline expectations to actual outcomes across passenger segments with error band visualization, (6) Stacked area chart showing cumulative positive/negative deviations with overlaid trend line and confidence intervals. Bottom row: (7) Diverging lollipop chart of passenger ID bins vs deviation scores with histogram overlay, (8) Combined errorbar and stripplot showing deviation spread patterns across passenger groups, (9) Multi-layered deviation heatmap with contour lines and marginal distribution plots showing the relationship between PassengerId position and survival prediction accuracy.
