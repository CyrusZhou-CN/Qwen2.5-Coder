Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of trading rates (stock prices) across all companies in the Nepal Stock Exchange dataset. Use data from at least 3 different company files to compare how stock prices are distributed. Include proper axis labels, a title, and a legend identifying which companies' data are being displayed. The histogram should help identify whether stock prices follow a normal distribution or show other patterns like skewness.
