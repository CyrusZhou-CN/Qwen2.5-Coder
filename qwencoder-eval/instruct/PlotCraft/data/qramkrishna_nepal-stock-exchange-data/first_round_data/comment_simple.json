    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and must be completely redone from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Chart Type:** Discard both the pie chart and the line plot. Create a single histogram using the 'Rate' column data as requested.\n2.  **KDE Overlay:** Add a kernel density estimate (KDE) line on top of the histogram to show a smoothed version of the distribution.\n3.  **Labels and Title:**\n    *   Set the main title to something informative, such as 'Distribution of Stock Prices in the Nepal Stock Exchange'. The title should be bolded for emphasis.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Stock Price (Rate)'.\n    *   Label the y-axis as 'Frequency' or 'Density'.\n4.  **Binning and Axis Range:**\n    *   Select an appropriate number of bins for the histogram to accurately reveal the shape of the distribution. An automatic method like the Freedman-Diaconis rule could be a good starting point.\n    *   Adjust the x-axis range to properly display the data. The current plot's data is all compressed at zero, indicating the scale is wrong.\n5.  **Color and Style:**\n    *   Use a professional color palette. For example, use a muted blue for the histogram bars and a contrasting dark gray or orange for the KDE line. Avoid the current neon colors.\n    *   Adopt a professional formatting standard: use a white background, remove the heavy gray background color, and use subtle, light-gray gridlines if necessary.\n6.  **Layout:** Create a single, well-proportioned 1x1 chart. Ensure there is balanced white space around the plot and that all elements (title, labels, plot area) are sized appropriately."
