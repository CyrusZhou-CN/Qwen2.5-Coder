    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus on fulfilling the task requirements and correcting clarity issues:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Stock Prices vs Trading Volumes:**\n    *   **Chart Type Correction:** The current bars are ambiguous. Replace them with clearly defined bar charts representing the trading volumes for each company, as requested. Ensure they are visually distinct from the price lines.\n    *   **Legend Correction:** The legend is critically flawed. It must be updated to accurately label both the line plots (e.g., 'NABIL Price') and the bar charts (e.g., 'NABIL Volume').\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Ensure the dual y-axes are clearly labeled as 'Average Stock Price' (left) and 'Trading Volume' (right).\n\n2.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Trading Intensity Heatmap:**\n    *   **Add Marginal Histograms:** This is a key missing requirement. Add a histogram above the heatmap to show the total transaction frequency for each 'Day of Week'. Add a second histogram to the right of the heatmap to show the total transaction frequency for each 'Hour of Day'.\n    *   **Color Scale Adjustment:** The current color bar range (59.0 to 60.0) is too narrow, making the heatmap uninformative. Adjust the color normalization (e.g., `vmin`, `vmax`) to span a more meaningful range, or investigate if the underlying data has enough variance to warrant a heatmap.\n\n3.  **General Enhancements (Across All Subplots):**\n    *   **Add Analytical Overlays:** Fulfill the prompt requirement by adding analytical elements. For instance, add a moving average line to the price trends in subplot (0, 0) and a linear trend line to the 'Transaction Count' in subplot (0, 1).\n    *   **Improve X-Axis Labeling:** The generic 'Time Period' x-axis in subplots (0, 0) and (0, 1) should be replaced with more descriptive time-based labels (e.g., specific dates like 'Jan 2021', 'Feb 2021') to meet the 'proper time-based indexing' requirement.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1) Y-Axis Scale:** The 'Transaction Count' line is nearly flat. Check the y-axis scale to ensure it's not compressing the visual representation of the data's variance. If the variance is indeed low, consider if another metric would be more insightful."
