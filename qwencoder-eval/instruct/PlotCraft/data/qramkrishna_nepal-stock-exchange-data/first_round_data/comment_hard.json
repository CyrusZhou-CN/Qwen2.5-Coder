    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart's visual quality is excellent, but it fails significantly on task compliance. The primary improvements needed are to rebuild the subplots to match the complex requirements of the prompt.\n\n1.  **Subplot (0,0) - Top-Left:** The prompt requires data for the 'top 5 most actively traded companies'. Modify the plot to include five distinct moving average trend lines, one for each company. Add a legend to identify which line corresponds to which company. The bar chart can represent the aggregate daily volume of these five companies.\n2.  **Subplot (0,1) - Top-Right:** The crucial missing elements are the marginal plots. Add a series of box plots along the top margin to show the distribution of trading amounts for each day of the week. Similarly, add box plots along the right margin to show the distribution for each hour of the day.\n3.  **Subplot (1,0) - Bottom-Left:** This subplot requires a complete redesign. Replace the current bar chart with a multi-layered stacked area chart. The x-axis must be temporal (e.g., 'Trading Days'). Each colored area should represent the cumulative trading volume of a specific stock sector over time. As requested, overlay individual, thinner trend lines for major companies on top of the area chart.\n4.  **Subplot (1,1) - Bottom-Right:** This plot also needs to be rebuilt. Instead of multiple lines, create a single line representing the price volatility trend over time. Add proper error bands (e.g., using `fill_between`) that follow the contour of this line to show confidence intervals. The current horizontal bands are incorrect. Most importantly, overlay scatter points on the line where the size of each point is proportional to the trading volume for that time period. Remove the current multi-line plot and legend, and add a legend or annotation explaining the sizing of the scatter points.\n5.  **Annotations:** As requested, add text annotations to the plots to highlight significant events, such as a label pointing to a peak in volatility in subplot (1,1) or the busiest hour in subplot (0,1)."
