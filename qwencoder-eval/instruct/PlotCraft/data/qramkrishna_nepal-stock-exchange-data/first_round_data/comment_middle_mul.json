    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart's visual presentation and quality, the following specific improvements are recommended:\n\n1.  **Layout and Element Positioning**:\n    *   Eliminate the excessive white space at the top of the figure. The entire chart area should be resized to fit the content without large empty gaps.\n    *   Reposition the 'Market Activity Peak' annotation. It should be placed closer to subplot (0, 0), and its arrow must point precisely to the highest data point on the blue 'Average Trading Rate' line to be meaningful.\n\n2.  **Task Fulfillment and Chart-Specific Adjustments**:\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Fulfill the prompt's requirement by adding the 'overlaid trend lines for each year' to the heatmap. This will allow for the analysis of long-term trends in addition to seasonality.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: Change the color of the 'Large Transactions' scatter plot points to a color that provides high contrast against all background area colors (e.g., black, white, or a bright lime green). The current red-on-red is unreadable. Consider reducing the alpha (opacity) of the points to better visualize their density.\n\n3.  **Text and Label Corrections**:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Add a descriptive label to the right-hand y-axis (e.g., 'Monthly Trading Volume'). A dual-axis chart is incomplete without labels for both axes.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1)**: Correct the legend by removing the erroneous 'Monthly Trading Volume (Million NPR)' entry.\n    *   Add at least two more specific annotations as requested, pointing to known market events (e.g., a financial crisis, a major policy change) on the relevant subplots.\n\n4.  **Color Scheme Enhancements**:\n    *   Establish a consistent color palette across the entire dashboard. For instance, if a specific color represents the 'Banking' sector in subplot (1, 1), use that same color for any top banking companies featured in subplot (0, 1). Use a consistent color for 'price/rate' and another for 'volume/volatility' throughout the dashboard to create a cohesive visual language."
