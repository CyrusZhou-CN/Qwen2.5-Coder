    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the pie charts with a histogram, which is the correct chart type for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable like stock prices. \n2. **Data Representation:** To compare the three companies, either create a faceted plot with three separate histograms (e.g., in a 3x1 grid) or overlay the three distributions on a single histogram. If overlaying, use different colors for each company and set a transparency level (e.g., alpha=0.6) to ensure all distributions are visible. \n3. **Titles and Labels:** The main title should be descriptive, such as 'Distribution of Trading Prices for Three NEPSE Companies'. The x-axis must be labeled 'Stock Price (NPR)' and the y-axis 'Frequency' or 'Density'. \n4. **Legend:** Add a clear legend to identify which color corresponds to which company. Place it in a non-obstructive area, such as the top-right corner of the plot. \n5. **Professional Formatting:** Adhere to professional standards: use a white background, ensure axis labels and titles are legible and appropriately sized, and select a color palette with distinct, harmonious colors for the three companies. The title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
