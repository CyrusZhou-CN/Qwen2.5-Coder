## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the evolution of stock trading patterns in the Nepal Stock Exchange. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization types:

Top-left: Create a dual-axis plot combining a line chart showing the daily average stock price trends over time with a bar chart overlay showing daily trading volumes for 3-4 major companies (like NABIL, NBL, SCB, EBL).

Top-right: Develop a stacked area chart showing the cumulative trading amounts by different broker categories over time, overlaid with a line plot showing the total number of unique transactions per day.

Bottom-left: Generate a combination of violin plots and box plots side-by-side showing the distribution of stock rates across different time periods (quarters/years), with scatter points overlaid to show individual high-volume transactions.

Bottom-right: Create a heatmap showing trading intensity (transaction frequency) across different hours of the day and days of the week, combined with marginal histograms showing the distribution of trading activity by time of day and day of week.

Use consistent color schemes across all subplots and ensure proper time-based indexing. Include trend lines, moving averages, and statistical annotations where appropriate.
