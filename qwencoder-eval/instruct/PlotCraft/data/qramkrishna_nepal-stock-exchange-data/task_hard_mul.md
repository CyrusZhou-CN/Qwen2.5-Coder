## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing temporal trading patterns and market dynamics in the Nepal Stock Exchange data. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: **Temporal Trading Volume Analysis**
- Subplot 1: Combine line chart showing daily total trading volume over time with bar chart overlay showing average transaction amounts, plus error bands indicating volume volatility
- Subplot 2: Create a dual-axis plot with histogram of trading frequencies by hour/time periods overlaid with KDE curve, plus scatter plot showing correlation between time and transaction sizes
- Subplot 3: Generate a stacked area chart showing cumulative trading volumes by different stock symbols over time, combined with line plot tracking the number of unique active traders

Row 2: **Price Movement and Broker Activity Patterns**
- Subplot 4: Construct a candlestick-style visualization showing price ranges (high-low) combined with volume bars and moving average lines for major stocks
- Subplot 5: Design a network-style scatter plot showing buyer-seller broker relationships overlaid with density contours, plus marginal histograms showing broker activity distributions
- Subplot 6: Build a multi-line time series showing price volatility trends for top 5 most traded stocks, combined with filled area charts indicating trading intensity periods

Row 3: **Market Concentration and Trading Behavior**
- Subplot 7: Create a treemap showing market share by stock symbols combined with bubble chart overlay indicating average transaction sizes, plus color-coding for price performance
- Subplot 8: Generate a correlation heatmap of trading patterns between different stocks overlaid with hierarchical clustering dendrogram showing market segments
- Subplot 9: Construct a comprehensive dashboard combining box plots showing price distributions by stock categories, violin plots for volume distributions, and scatter plot matrix showing relationships between key trading metrics

Each subplot must integrate at least 2-3 different visualization types and use data from multiple CSV files to reveal complex temporal patterns, market microstructure, and trading dynamics in the Nepal Stock Exchange.
