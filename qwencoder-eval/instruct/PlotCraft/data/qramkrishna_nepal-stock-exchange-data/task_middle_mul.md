# Visualization Task - Middle

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis dashboard showing the evolution of Nepal's stock market from 2007 to 2019. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques:

Top-left: Create a dual-axis plot combining a line chart showing the average daily trading rate over time with a bar chart overlay showing monthly trading volume (total amount traded). Use different colors and scales to clearly distinguish between price trends and volume patterns.

Top-right: Develop a multi-company comparison chart that combines line plots for the top 5 most actively traded companies (by total transaction count) over time, with a background area chart showing the overall market volatility (standard deviation of rates within each month).

Bottom-left: Design a seasonal analysis combining a heatmap showing average trading rates by month and year with overlaid trend lines for each year, revealing both cyclical patterns and long-term trends in the market.

Bottom-right: Create a market concentration analysis combining a stacked area chart showing the proportion of total trading volume by company category (banks, insurance, manufacturing, etc.) over time, with scatter plot overlays showing individual large transactions (amount > 100,000) to highlight market events.

Use consistent color schemes across all subplots, add proper legends, and ensure all time axes are synchronized. Include annotations for significant market events or periods of high volatility.
