## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive symptom composition analysis using a 2x1 subplot layout. In the top subplot, create a horizontal stacked bar chart showing the top 15 most frequent symptoms across all diseases, with each bar segment colored by disease category and displaying the proportion each disease contributes to that symptom's total occurrence. In the bottom subplot, create a treemap visualization showing the hierarchical composition of symptoms within the top 8 most common diseases, where the size of each rectangle represents the frequency of that symptom within the disease, and colors distinguish different symptom categories (e.g., skin-related, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological symptoms based on symptom names).
