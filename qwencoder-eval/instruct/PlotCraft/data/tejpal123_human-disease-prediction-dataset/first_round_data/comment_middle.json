    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Layout Correction**: The primary issue is the layout. Re-render the chart to a 2x1 grid, placing the stacked bar chart in the top subplot (0, 0) and the treemap in the bottom subplot (1, 0). Remove the 'ERROR 404 Chart Not Found' message entirely.\n2. **Subplot (0, 0) - Stacked Bar Chart**: \n   - **Titles and Labels**: Change the title from 'Banana Composition' to a descriptive title like 'Proportional Contribution of Disease Categories to Top 15 Symptoms'. Swap the axis labels: the y-axis should be 'Symptom' and the x-axis should be 'Proportion'.\n   - **Legend and Coloring**: This is a critical fix. The data must be aggregated by 'disease category' as requested. Replace the 40-item 'Zorg' legend with a concise legend representing these categories. Use a professional, categorical color palette (e.g., `matplotlib.colormaps['tab10']`) instead of the current neon colors. Move the legend outside the plot area to the right to avoid overlap.\n3. **Subplot (1, 0) - Treemap**:\n   - **Title**: Replace 'Symptom Jungle' with a professional title such as 'Symptom Composition within Top 8 Diseases'.\n   - **Coloring**: The coloring logic must be completely changed. The instruction was to color by *symptom category* (e.g., skin-related, respiratory). Implement this by mapping symptoms to categories and applying a distinct color for each category. Add a legend to explain this color mapping.\n   - **Text Readability**: Improve the labels within the treemap by implementing text wrapping or dynamically reducing font size for smaller rectangles to ensure readability and prevent truncation.\n4. **Overall Professional Formatting**:\n   - **Background and Grid**: Switch to a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines (or remove them).\n   - **Typography**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main figure title (if any) and subplot titles bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
