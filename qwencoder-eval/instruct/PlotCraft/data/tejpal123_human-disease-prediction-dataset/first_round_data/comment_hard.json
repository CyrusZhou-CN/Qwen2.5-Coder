    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. The primary focus should be on implementing the correct chart types, followed by visual refinement.\n\n1.  **Implement Correct Chart Types**: \n    - **Subplot (0, 1)**: Convert the bar chart to a `stacked bar chart`.\n    - **Subplot (0, 2)**: Replace the text box with an adjacent `donut chart` to visualize the train/test split.\n    - **Subplot (1, 0)**: Add a `hierarchical clustering dendrogram` to the left or top of the heatmap.\n    - **Subplot (1, 1)**: Replace the single scatter plot with a full `scatter plot matrix (pairplot)` for 6 key symptoms, ensuring marginal histograms are on the diagonal.\n    - **Subplot (1, 2)**: Overlay `box plots` and `jittered data points` onto the violin plots. Ensure the x-axis represents `disease categories`, not individual diseases.\n    - **Subplot (2, 0)**: Re-implement this as a proper `network graph`. Nodes should represent diseases, and `edges` should connect them, with thickness proportional to symptom overlap. Remove the current x and y axes.\n    - **Subplot (2, 2)**: Overlay a `polar bar chart` on the existing radar chart to show symptom importance scores.\n\n2.  **Enhance Visual Cohesion and Clarity**:\n    - **Color Scheme**: Define a single categorical color palette and use it consistently across all subplots that map color to disease or category (e.g., (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)).\n    - **Layout and Spacing**: Use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()`) to automatically adjust subplot parameters for a tight, balanced layout. Increase the overall figure size to prevent elements from feeling cramped.\n    - **Text Formatting**: \n        - Ensure all labels on axes and in legends are complete and not truncated (e.g., 'Fungal infection' not 'Fungal inf').\n        - For the heatmap in subplot (1, 0), ensure the full x-axis labels are visible by adjusting the bottom margin of the figure.\n        - For the network graph in subplot (2, 0), use a text adjustment library or a force-directed layout to prevent node labels from overlapping.\n    - **Titles and Legends**: Ensure all titles are descriptive and consistently formatted. Position legends to avoid obscuring data; for the full grid, a single figure-level legend might be more effective if colors are consistent."
