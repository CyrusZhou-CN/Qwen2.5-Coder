## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing petrol station clusters and regional patterns in Pakistan. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Scatter plot with density contours showing HSD vs PMG prices colored by province with overlaid trend lines for each province, (2) Top-center: Grouped violin plots showing fuel price distributions by province with embedded box plots, (3) Top-right: Hierarchical cluster heatmap of stations based on fuel prices with dendrogram and province annotations, (4) Middle-left: Network graph showing connections between cities based on similar fuel pricing patterns with node sizes representing station counts, (5) Middle-center: Parallel coordinates plot displaying multi-dimensional fuel pricing profiles grouped by province with highlighted cluster centroids, (6) Middle-right: Treemap showing hierarchical composition of stations by province and district with fuel price color coding, (7) Bottom-left: Radar chart comparing average fuel pricing profiles across provinces with confidence intervals, (8) Bottom-center: 2D histogram with marginal distributions showing the joint distribution of HSD and PMG prices segmented by province, (9) Bottom-right: Cluster validation plot showing silhouette analysis and elbow method results for optimal grouping of stations based on pricing patterns.
