Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing fuel price deviations across different regions in Pakistan. Design a subplot with two charts: (1) a diverging bar chart displaying the difference between HSD (High Speed Diesel) and PMG (Premium Motor Gasoline) prices for each petrol station, with bars extending left for negative differences and right for positive differences from zero, and (2) a dumbbell plot comparing HSD vs PMG prices by district/province, where each dumbbell shows the price range between the two fuel types for different geographical regions. Use different colors to distinguish between fuel types and add reference lines to highlight the overall average price differences.
