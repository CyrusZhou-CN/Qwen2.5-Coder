## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of HSD (High Speed Diesel) prices across all petrol stations in Pakistan. Use the 'Pump Price Rs/ Liter' column which contains HSD prices, convert the string values to numeric, and display the frequency distribution with appropriate bins. Add a title, axis labels, and ensure the plot clearly shows the price range and frequency of different HSD price points.
