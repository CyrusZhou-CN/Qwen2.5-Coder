    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1. **Layout and Structure:** Create a 2x1 subplot layout. The top subplot (0, 0) should be the diverging bar chart, and the bottom subplot (1, 0) should be the dumbbell plot. Add a single, clear main title for the entire figure, such as 'Fuel Price Deviations (HSD vs. PMG) in Pakistan'.\n2. **Subplot (0, 0) - Diverging Bar Chart:**\n   - **Data:** Plot the calculated difference (HSD Price - PMG Price) for each petrol station.\n   - **Axes:** The y-axis should list the 'Petrol Stations'. The x-axis should be 'Price Difference (Rs/Liter)', centered at zero.\n   - **Bars:** Bars should extend to the right for positive values (HSD > PMG) and to the left for negative values (HSD < PMG).\n   - **Color:** Use a two-color scheme to distinguish positive and negative bars (e.g., blue for positive, orange for negative).\n   - **Reference Line:** Add a vertical dashed line at x=0 to emphasize the zero-difference point.\n3. **Subplot (1, 0) - Dumbbell Plot:**\n   - **Data:** For each 'District/Province' on the y-axis, plot the price range between HSD and PMG on the x-axis.\n   - **Axes:** The y-axis should be 'District/Province'. The x-axis should be 'Price (Rs/Liter)'.\n   - **Elements:** Use a line segment to connect the two price points for each province. Mark the HSD and PMG prices with distinct colored dots (e.g., blue for HSD, orange for PMG).\n   - **Legend:** Add a clear legend to identify the colors for HSD and PMG.\n4. **General Formatting and Professionalism:**\n   - **Theme:** Use a clean, professional theme with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n   - **Text:** Ensure all titles, axis labels, and annotations are correct, relevant, and legible. Use a clear typographic hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than subplot titles.\n   - **Colors:** Select a professional, harmonious color palette. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors.\n   - **Remove Clutter:** Eliminate all nonsensical and distracting elements like the pie chart, 'Glarbnok's Revenge' text box, and incorrect labels."
