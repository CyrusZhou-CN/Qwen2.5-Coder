    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Correct Chart Type and Data**: Discard both the pie and line charts. Create a single **histogram** using the HSD price data as specified. The x-axis must represent the price bins, and the y-axis must represent the frequency count.\n2. **Accurate Text Content**: \n   - Change the main title to something relevant, such as 'Distribution of High Speed Diesel (HSD) Prices in Pakistan'.\n   - Label the x-axis 'HSD Price (Rs/Liter)'.\n   - Label the y-axis 'Frequency' or 'Number of Stations'.\n3. **Professional Formatting**: \n   - Use a white background for a clean, publication-ready appearance.\n   - If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin) and consider using them only on the y-axis to guide the eye.\n   - Create a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and a larger font size than the axis labels.\n4. **Color Scheme**: Replace the jarring rainbow and neon colors with a professional and simple color palette. A single, muted color (e.g., steel blue, medium gray) for the histogram bars would be appropriate."
