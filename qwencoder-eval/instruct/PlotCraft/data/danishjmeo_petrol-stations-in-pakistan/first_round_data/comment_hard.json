Increase the `y` parameter (e.g., `y=0.98`) if needed.\n    *   Increase the horizontal and vertical spacing between subplots using `fig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.3, hspace=0.4)` to prevent a cramped appearance.\n3.  **Text and Readability:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** For the violin plot, consider shortening the x-axis labels (e.g., 'Pun HSD' instead of 'Punjab HSD') to improve readability and potentially avoid rotation.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** Ensure the y-axis labels ('Inertia', 'Silhouette Score') do not collide with the tick labels by adjusting their positioning.\n    *   **General:** Standardize font sizes for all subplot titles and axis labels to create a more cohesive and professional look. Make subplot titles bold to distinguish them from axis labels."
