    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt requirements and achieve a professional standard. The following specific actions are needed:\n\n1.  **Fulfill Task Requirements**: First and foremost, add all missing components to each subplot:\n    *   **(0, 0)**: Add marginal histograms on the top and right axes.\n    *   **(0, 1)**: Add the confidence interval shading around the regression line.\n    *   **(0, 2)**: Overlay a swarm plot or jittered scatter plot to show individual data points.\n    *   **(1, 0)**: Add a secondary y-axis and a line plot for 'average round duration'.\n    *   **(1, 1)**: Add a hierarchical clustering dendrogram to the y-axis (weight classes) and ensure cell annotations are percentages, not counts.\n    *   **(1, 2)**: Change the data to include the top 5 weight classes (not 3) and add error bars to the data points.\n    *   **(2, 0)**: Add trend lines for key locations and a seasonal decomposition component (this might require an additional linked subplot).\n    *   **(2, 1)**: Re-create the network graph to correctly show a bipartite network with connections between location nodes and weight class nodes.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing**: Use `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to fix the excessive vertical spacing between rows and create a compact, cohesive grid.\n\n3.  **Legends and Labels**:\n    *   **Legends**: For plots with too many categories like (1,0) and (2,0), the legends are unusable. For (1,0), group the least frequent fight methods into an 'Other' category. For (2,0), plot only the top 5-7 locations by fight frequency and group the rest, or remove the legend entirely and annotate the lines directly.\n    *   **X-Axis Labels**: Fix all overlapping labels. In (0,2), ensure there is proper spacing between 'Lightweight', 'Welterweight', etc. In (1,0) and (1,1), rotate the labels to 45 or 90 degrees to prevent overlap (`plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`).\n\n4.  **Plot-Specific Refinements**:\n    *   **(1, 1) Heatmap**: The number of 'Method' categories is too high. Filter to show only the top 20 most frequent methods to make the x-axis readable.\n    *   **(1, 2) Radar Chart**: The radial axis scale is dominated by the 'STR' metric. Apply a log scale to the radial axis or normalize all metrics to a common scale (e.g., 0 to 1) so that variations in KD, TD, and SUB are visible.\n    *   **(2, 2) Parallel Coordinates**: Increase the transparency (alpha) of the lines to better visualize density and identify common patterns.\n\n5.  **Professional Formatting**: Add a main, overarching title for the entire 3x3 figure (e.g., 'UFC Performance and Dynamics Analysis'). For a cleaner aesthetic, consider removing the top and right spines from each subplot's axes."
