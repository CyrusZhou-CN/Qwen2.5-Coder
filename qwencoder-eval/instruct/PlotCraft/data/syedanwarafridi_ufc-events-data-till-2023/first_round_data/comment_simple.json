    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and cannot be salvaged. It must be completely recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the pie and line charts with a single histogram to correctly visualize the distribution of the data.\n2. **Data Representation:** Use the 'Significant Strikes Landed by Fighter 1' data for the histogram. Set the number of bins to 15 as requested (`bins=15`).\n3. **Labels and Title:** \n   - Set the chart title to 'Distribution of Significant Strikes Landed by Fighter 1 in UFC Matches'.\n   - Set the x-axis label to 'Significant Strikes Landed by Fighter 1'.\n   - Set the y-axis label to 'Frequency'.\n4. **Annotations:**\n   - Calculate the mean of the data.\n   - Add a vertical line on the histogram at the calculated mean value. Use a distinct color (e.g., red) and a dashed line style for visibility.\n   - Add a text annotation near the line indicating the mean value, formatted to one decimal place (e.g., 'Mean: 43.1'). Position this text so it does not overlap with the histogram bars.\n5. **Formatting:**\n   - Use a professional, clean style with a white background and subtle gray gridlines.\n   - Ensure the title is bold and has a larger font size than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n   - Use a single, standard color (e.g., steelblue or gray) for the histogram bars."
