    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to populate the top subplot (0, 0) with the required data. Specifically: (1) Add the scatter plot points representing Fighter 1's significant strikes vs. Fighter 2's significant strikes. (2) Implement the coloring of these points based on the fight winner and add a corresponding legend to explain the color mapping. (3) Apply the sizing of the points based on the round number, as described in the existing legend. (4) The legend in subplot (0, 0) should be updated to clearly indicate what the colors represent (the winner), as it currently only describes the point sizes for rounds. Separating the legends for color and size would improve clarity."
