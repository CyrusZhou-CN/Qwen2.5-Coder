# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between fighter performance metrics and fight outcomes. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a scatter plot of Fighter 1's significant strikes (STR) vs Fighter 2's significant strikes (STR), with points colored by the winner and sized by the round number. Add a diagonal reference line to highlight cases where Fighter 1 outperformed Fighter 2 in strikes. The bottom plot should display a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between all numerical performance metrics (KD, STR, TD, SUB) for both fighters, using a diverging color scheme to emphasize positive and negative correlations.
