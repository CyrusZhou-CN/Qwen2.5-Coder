Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive income distribution analysis using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left, display overlapping histograms with KDE curves for age distribution by income level (<=50K vs >50K). In the top-right, show overlapping histograms with KDE curves for hours-per-week distribution by income level. In the bottom-left, create overlapping histograms with KDE curves for education-num distribution by income level. In the bottom-right, display overlapping histograms with KDE curves for capital-gain distribution by income level (limit capital-gain to values <= 10000 to focus on the main distribution). Use different colors and transparency for each income group, include legends, and add appropriate titles and axis labels for each subplot.
