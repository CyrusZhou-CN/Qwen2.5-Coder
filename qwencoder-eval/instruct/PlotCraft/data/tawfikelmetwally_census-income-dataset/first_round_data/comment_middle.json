    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical issue is the complete absence of data. The chart must be regenerated to include the overlapping histograms and KDE curves as specified in the prompt.\n\nAssuming the data is plotted correctly in a future version, here are specific suggestions for visual improvement:\n1.  **Correct Axis Ranges:** The tick mark values on all x and y axes must be corrected to reflect the actual range of the data being plotted. For example, the x-axis for subplot (0, 0) should represent a realistic age range (e.g., 15-90).\n2.  **Consolidate Legends:** The legend is identical and repeated in all four subplots. This is redundant. Remove the individual legends from each subplot and create a single, shared legend for the entire figure, placing it in a suitable location like the top-right or bottom-right corner outside the plot areas.\n3.  **Refine Title Hierarchy:** Reduce the font size of the main title ('Income Distribution Analysis...') and increase the vertical spacing between it and the top-row subplots to improve visual balance and reduce crowding.\n4.  **Modernize Legend Style:** Replace the shadowed/beveled legend box style with a simple, flat design (e.g., `frameon=False` or a thin, black border) for a more modern and professional appearance.\n5.  **Use a Pure White Background:** For formal publication standards, change the very light gray background to pure white (`#FFFFFF`)."
