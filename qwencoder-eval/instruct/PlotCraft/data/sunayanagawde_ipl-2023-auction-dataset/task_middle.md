## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive composition analysis of IPL auction spending patterns using a 2x2 subplot grid. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Create a stacked bar chart showing total spending by team with overlay pie charts for each team showing the proportion spent on different player types (Batter, Bowler, All-Rounder, etc.), (2) Top-right: Design a treemap showing team spending hierarchy with nested rectangles for player types within each team, overlaid with text annotations showing the percentage of budget allocated to Indian vs Overseas players, (3) Bottom-left: Construct a waffle chart displaying the overall auction budget distribution across all teams, with each square representing a fixed amount and different colors for different teams, supplemented with a small pie chart showing nationality composition, (4) Bottom-right: Build a stacked area chart showing cumulative spending progression if players are sorted by price within each team, with different colored areas for different player types and team boundaries marked with vertical lines.
