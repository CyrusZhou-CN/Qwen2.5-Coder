    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign to become readable and compliant. The initial prompt is overly ambitious for a static 2x2 grid.\n\n1.  **Overall Layout & Title:** Combine the main title into a single, clear line (e.g., 'IPL Auction Spending Analysis (2013-2023)') and add significant vertical space between it and the subplots. Increase the `hspace` and `wspace` between subplots for better separation.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Stacked Bar Chart:**\n    *   **Remove Overlays:** Eliminate the overlay pie charts entirely. They are the primary source of clutter and obscure the underlying data. If this compositional detail is essential, create a separate, dedicated chart for it.\n    *   **Improve Labels:** Convert the chart to a horizontal stacked bar chart. This will provide ample space for team names on the y-axis, eliminating the need for rotated, overlapping labels.\n    *   **Fix Legend:** Consolidate the legend to have one unique entry per player type.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Treemap:**\n    *   **Correct Annotations:** Replace the current illegible annotations with the required data: a single, clear text label inside each parent (team) rectangle showing the Indian vs. Overseas spending percentage (e.g., 'IND: 65%, OS: 35%').\n    *   **Reduce Clutter:** Do not label the smaller, nested rectangles (player types). Their relative size already conveys the information. Use a clear, shared legend for player types instead.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Waffle/Pie Chart:**\n    *   **Reposition Elements:** Move the 'Nationality Split' pie chart so it does not overlap the waffle chart. Place it to the right or below the waffle chart, ensuring all elements are contained within the subplot's boundaries without touching.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Cumulative Spending Chart:**\n    *   **Correct Chart Type & Data:** This subplot is fundamentally flawed. It must be rebuilt to show *cumulative* spending. The y-axis should represent the cumulative sum of spending, not individual player prices. The chart should show rising areas for each team, not a series of thin spikes.\n    *   **Improve X-axis:** Instead of showing hundreds of player ticks, the x-axis should be categorical by team. A better visualization would be a series of small, stacked area charts (one for each team) or a single stacked bar chart where each segment represents a player, ordered by price."
