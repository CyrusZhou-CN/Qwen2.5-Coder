    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete regeneration as it fails to meet nearly all task requirements. Key improvements include:\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Re-structure the entire figure into the specified 2x2 subplot grid using a command like `fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2)`.\n2.  **Chart Type Implementation:** Replace the incorrect charts with the ones requested:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** The overlaid dots should be replaced with a proper line plot connecting the average price per player for each team. A secondary y-axis might be needed for clarity.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Implement a nested donut chart inside the pie chart to show the nationality breakdown as required.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** This plot must be a treemap, not a line chart. Use a library like `squarify` to create the hierarchical visualization of teams and player types.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** The missing waffle chart matrix needs to be created.\n3.  **Text and Labeling:** All text must be corrected. Replace the nonsensical titles with descriptive ones relevant to IPL auction data (e.g., 'Team Spending by Player Type', 'Spending Distribution'). Correct the swapped axis labels in the top chart to 'Team' (y-axis) and 'Total Spending' (x-axis).\n4.  **Color Palette:** Discard the current neon color scheme. Adopt a professional and harmonious color palette, such as one from `matplotlib.cm.tab10` or a custom palette with better contrast and visual appeal.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:** Switch to a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines (e.g., `plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')` or manually set `facecolor='white'`). Ensure titles are bolded and larger than axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy."
