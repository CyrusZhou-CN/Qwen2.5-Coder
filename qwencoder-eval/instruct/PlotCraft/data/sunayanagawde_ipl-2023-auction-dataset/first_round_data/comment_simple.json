    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the user's prompt. It needs to be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the current 2x1 layout of a bar and line chart with a single pie chart in a 1x1 layout as requested.\n2. **Data and Content:** The data presented is incorrect and irrelevant. The new chart must use the correct IPL 2023 auction dataset to calculate the percentage distribution of player types. Ensure the percentages sum to 100%. Consolidate redundant categories like 'Batsman'/'Batter' and 'Wicket Keeper'/'Wicket-Keeper' into single categories.\n3. **Text Elements:** All text must be corrected. The title should be relevant, such as 'Distribution of Player Types in IPL 2023 Auction'. The labels for the pie slices should be the player types, and the corresponding correct percentages should be displayed clearly on or next to each slice.\n4. **Color Scheme:** Discard the current harsh, saturated color palette. Use a more harmonious and professional color scheme with distinct but visually pleasing colors for each pie segment.\n5. **Formatting:** The chart should be formatted professionally with a white background and no distracting gridlines. Ensure all labels are legible and do not overlap."
