Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing IPL auction spending patterns across teams and player categories. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Create a stacked bar chart showing total spending by team with overlaid line plot indicating average price per player for each team, (2) Top-right: Design a pie chart displaying spending distribution across player types (Batter, Bowler, All-Rounder, etc.) with an inner donut chart showing the nationality breakdown within each type, (3) Bottom-left: Construct a treemap visualization showing hierarchical spending where teams are primary rectangles and player types are nested sub-rectangles, with size representing total spending and color intensity representing average player price, (4) Bottom-right: Build a waffle chart matrix displaying team-wise player type composition where each waffle represents a team and squares within each waffle are colored by player type, with square size proportional to spending on that player type.
