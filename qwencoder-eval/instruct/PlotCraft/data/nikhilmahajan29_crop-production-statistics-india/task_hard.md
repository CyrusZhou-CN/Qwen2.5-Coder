## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing temporal trends in Indian crop production across different dimensions. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Line chart with confidence bands showing total production trends over years overlaid with a bar chart showing annual production variance, (2) Top-center: Stacked area chart showing seasonal production composition over time with a secondary line plot showing season diversity index, (3) Top-right: Multi-line time series showing top 5 crops' production trends with scatter points highlighting peak years, (4) Middle-left: Heatmap calendar showing monthly production patterns overlaid with trend arrows indicating directional changes, (5) Middle-center: Slope chart connecting production values between first and last available years for each state with error bars showing volatility, (6) Middle-right: Time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of total yield, (7) Bottom-left: Dual-axis plot combining area chart of cumulative production with line chart of year-over-year growth rates, (8) Bottom-center: Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots for production time series with significance bands, (9) Bottom-right: Cross-correlation plot between area and production over time with lagged relationships and confidence intervals.
