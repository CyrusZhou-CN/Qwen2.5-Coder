## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal evolution of crop production in India. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart showing the total production trends over years (1997-2023) for the top 5 most produced crops, with each crop represented by a different colored line. The bottom plot should be an area chart showing the seasonal distribution of total production over the same time period, with different seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Autumn) stacked to show how seasonal patterns have changed over time. Include proper legends, titles, and ensure the y-axes are appropriately scaled to highlight the trends.
