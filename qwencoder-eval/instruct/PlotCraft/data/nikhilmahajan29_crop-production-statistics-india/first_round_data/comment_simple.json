    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the user's prompt in any meaningful way. It needs to be completely redone from scratch.\n\n1.  **Chart Type:** Discard the scatter plot and pie chart. Create a single **histogram**.\n2.  **Data Mapping:** The histogram's x-axis should represent the 'crop yield' values. The y-axis should represent the frequency (count) of records for each yield range.\n3.  **Binning:** Select an appropriate number of bins for the histogram (e.g., 20-30) to clearly visualize the shape of the yield distribution.\n4.  **Text Content:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Change the title to something accurate and descriptive as requested, such as 'Distribution of Crop Yield for Indian Crop Production'.\n    *   **X-Axis Label:** Set the label to 'Crop Yield (tons/ha)'.\n    *   **Y-Axis Label:** Set the label to 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n    *   **Remove Extraneous Text:** Delete all nonsensical text elements like 'Banana Output in Space', 'Distribution of Unicorns', 'Glarbnok's Revenge', and the pie chart labels.\n5.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   **Color:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a standard blue or gray) for the histogram bars. Avoid the multi-colored rainbow palette.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** Ensure the main title is visually distinct (e.g., bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels) to create a clear visual hierarchy."
