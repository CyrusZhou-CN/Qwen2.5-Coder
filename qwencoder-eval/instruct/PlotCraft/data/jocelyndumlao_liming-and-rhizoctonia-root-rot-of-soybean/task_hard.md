## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal progression and dose-response relationships of limestone application on soybean health and yield across different soil types. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 - Disease Progression Analysis:
- Subplot 1: Line chart showing AUDPC (Area Under Disease Progress Curve) trends across limestone doses (0, 3, 6, 9 Mg ha-1) with error bars, overlaid with scatter points showing individual measurements, faceted by soil type
- Subplot 2: Dual-axis plot combining bar chart of disease incidence (INC) by dose with overlaid line chart showing yield response, grouped by soil type with different colors
- Subplot 3: Stacked area chart showing the cumulative effect of limestone doses on disease reduction over soil types, with trend lines indicating optimal dosing

Row 2 - Plant Development Metrics:
- Subplot 4: Multi-line time series-style plot showing plant height (PLH) and insertion height (INSH) progression across limestone doses, with confidence intervals and separate lines for inside/outside patch locations
- Subplot 5: Bubble plot where x-axis is limestone dose, y-axis is number of branches (BRA), bubble size represents total nodes (TNOD), and color intensity shows fertile nodes (FNOD), with regression lines
- Subplot 6: Violin plots showing distribution of pods per plant (PODS) across doses, overlaid with box plots and individual data points, separated by soil type

Row 3 - Yield and Quality Analysis:
- Subplot 7: Heatmap showing correlation matrix between limestone dose and yield components (YIELD, GRAINS, WEIGHT), with hierarchical clustering dendrograms on axes
- Subplot 8: Slope chart connecting yield values between 0 Mg ha-1 and 9 Mg ha-1 doses for each soil type, with intermediate dose points shown as scatter overlay
- Subplot 9: Composite radar chart comparing normalized performance metrics (yield, plant health, disease resistance) across soil types at optimal limestone doses, with overlaid bar chart showing absolute yield values
