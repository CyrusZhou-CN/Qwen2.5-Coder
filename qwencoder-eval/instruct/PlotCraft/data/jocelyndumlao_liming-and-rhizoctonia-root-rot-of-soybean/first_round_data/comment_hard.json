    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to comply with the specified chart types and visualization requirements. The visual quality is high, but the content is incorrect.\n\n**Task Compliance Corrections (Highest Priority):**\n1.  **Subplot (0,1):** Convert this from a grouped bar chart into a dual-axis plot. Use the left y-axis for the bar chart of disease incidence (INC) and add a second y-axis on the right for a line chart showing yield response.\n2.  **Subplot (0,2):** Replace the current line chart with a stacked area chart to illustrate the cumulative effect of limestone doses on disease reduction across soil types.\n3.  **Subplot (1,2):** Replace the box plots with violin plots to show the distribution of pods per plant. Overlay the box plots within the violins and add jittered individual data points as requested. This plot must also be faceted or grouped by soil type, which is currently missing.\n4.  **Subplot (2,0):** Enhance the heatmap by adding the required hierarchical clustering dendrograms to both the row and column axes.\n5.  **Subplot (2,1):** Change the line chart to a proper slope chart. The primary lines should connect the yield values between the 0 and 9 Mg ha-1 doses for each soil type. The intermediate dose points (3 and 6) should be shown as a scatter overlay, not as part of the main connected line.\n6.  **Subplot (2,2):** Replace the grouped bar chart with a composite radar chart to compare the normalized performance metrics as requested.\n\n**Text and Formatting Improvements:**\n1.  **Subplot (1,1):** Change the title from 'Branches vs Dose (Size=Total Nodes, Color=Fertile Nodes)' to a more descriptive title, such as 'Impact of Limestone Dose on Branch and Node Development'.\n2.  **Subplot (2,2):** If this plot were corrected to a bar chart, the axis labels should be improved. 'Values' should be a more specific unit, and 'Metrics' should be 'Performance Metric'.\n3.  **Consistency:** Ensure the x-axis label 'Limestone Dose (Mg ha⁻¹)' is consistently applied to all relevant subplots where it is the independent variable."
