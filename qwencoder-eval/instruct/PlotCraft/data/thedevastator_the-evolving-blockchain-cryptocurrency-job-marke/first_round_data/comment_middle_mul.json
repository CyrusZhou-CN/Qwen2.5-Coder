    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Fix Failed Subplots**: The primary issue is the failure to generate the lollipop chart at (0, 1) and the missing color encoding at (0, 0). This suggests a data processing error that must be resolved.\n2. **Subplot (0, 0) - Horizontal Bar Chart**: Implement the required color encoding. Use a sequential colormap (e.g., 'viridis' or 'plasma') to color the bars based on the average salary. Add a color bar to the side of the plot to serve as a legend for the salary values.\n3. **Subplot (0, 1) - Lollipop Chart**: Generate the requested lollipop chart. If data is truly unavailable, the plot area should still be formatted correctly with labeled axes ('Company', 'Average Salary') and a clear, centered message like 'Salary Data Not Available'. Do not leave it as a blank, unformatted plot.\n4. **Subplot (1, 1) - Scatter Plot**: \n   - **Resolve Text Overlap**: This is critical. Use a text repulsion algorithm (e.g., `adjustText` in Python) to automatically reposition the company labels to prevent them from overlapping. For dense clusters, consider labeling only the most prominent data points.\n   - **Improve Color Scheme**: Replace the current colors with a more intuitive, sequential palette for employee count (e.g., light green for 'Small', medium green for 'Medium', dark green for 'Large', and blue for 'Very Large'). Use gray for 'Unknown'.\n   - **Reorder Legend**: The legend for employee count should be ordered logically: Small, Medium, Large, Very Large, Unknown.\n5. **Overall Formatting**: Add a main figure title (e.g., 'Hiring and Funding Landscape of Top Crypto Companies') to provide overall context for the 2x2 grid. Ensure font sizes for titles, axis labels, and tick labels are consistent across all four subplots for a cohesive appearance."
