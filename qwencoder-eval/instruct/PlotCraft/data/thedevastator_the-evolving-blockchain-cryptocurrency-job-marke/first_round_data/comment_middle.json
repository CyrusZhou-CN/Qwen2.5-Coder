    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet the requirements for subplot (0, 0). To fix this, you must: (1) Implement a bar chart for the 'Average Salary Range' as requested, instead of the current secondary axis line plot. (2) Correct the data for the average salary; the current scale of -0.04 to 0.04 is incorrect and should be replaced with a meaningful salary scale (e.g., in thousands of dollars). For subplot (1, 1), improve the x-axis readability by changing the label to 'Total Funding (in Billions of $)' and formatting the tick labels as simple numbers (e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) instead of scientific notation. In subplot (1, 0), the legend is slightly cramped; consider moving it to the upper right or outside the plot area to improve spacing. Finally, add a main, overarching title to the entire figure (e.g., 'Blockchain Job Market Trends 2019') to unify the four plots into a single, cohesive dashboard."
