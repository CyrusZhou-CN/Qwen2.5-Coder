    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, focus on correcting the task compliance failures and enhancing clarity:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** This chart must be re-implemented. The line chart should plot the total of the stacked areas, representing 'Total Job Postings'. Remove the second y-axis ('Category Distribution') as it is confusing and not requested. The single y-axis on the left should be labeled 'Number of Job Postings'.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** This subplot needs a complete redesign. Replace the current generic heatmap with a proper 'calendar heatmap' that visualizes daily data over the two-year period (e.g., with days of the week on the y-axis and weeks of the year on the x-axis). The line chart overlay is visually cluttered; consider placing it in a separate, linked plot below the heatmap to improve readability.\n\n2.  **Text and Label Improvements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Change the y-axis label from 'Hiring Index' to a more descriptive title like 'Hiring Trend Index' or 'Monthly Hiring Volume'.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** The axes for the heatmap must be changed to represent time. The x-axis ticks (0, 5, 10, 15, 20) are meaningless for a time series; they should be formatted as dates (e.g., '2018-04', '2018-10', '2019-04').\n\n3.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between the rows of subplots to provide more breathing room and prevent titles from crowding the plots above them. This can be done using `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)` or a similar function.\n\n4.  **Visual Refinements:**\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Improve the contrast between the line charts and the stacked area chart. Either increase the transparency of the area fills (e.g., `alpha=0.3`) or use more distinct, contrasting colors for the lines so they stand out more clearly.\n    *   **Overall Cohesion:** Consider creating a unified color palette to be used across all six plots to create a more professional and cohesive dashboard. For example, consistently use the same color for the same company or category across different charts."
