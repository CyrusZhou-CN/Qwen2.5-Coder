    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following adjustments are recommended:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** Regenerate this chart to show histogram/KDE curves for different *time periods* (e.g., one curve for 2018, another for 2019) as requested, instead of grouping by company size.\n    *   **Subplot (2,1):** Re-implement this as a true 'network-style' chart. For each location, draw a connecting line or arrow from its 2018 position/bubble to its 2019 position/bubble to explicitly visualize the 'evolution'.\n\n2.  **Clarity and Overlap:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** The five lines are too cluttered. Either apply a smoothing algorithm (e.g., a 3-month rolling average) to each line to reduce noise or replace this single plot with five small multiples, one for each company.\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** Adjust the positions of the percentage annotations to prevent them from overlapping with the black 'Tech %' line.\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** Improve the readability of contour labels by placing them on a small white background or ensuring they are positioned in clear areas away from the lines.\n\n3.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the overall figure size and adjust the subplot spacing (`hspace` and `wspace`) to provide more breathing room between plots, especially around those with color bars and secondary axes.\n\n4.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Subplot (2,1):** Correct the color encoding. Remove the incorrect color bar for 'Average Salary' and rely on the legend to explain that colors/markers represent the year. Add a label for the y-axis.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** Reformat the x-axis ticks to display meaningful dates (e.g., '2018-01', '2018-04', etc.) instead of abstract integers (0, 5, 10...). \n    *   **Top Row (0,0), (0,1), (0,2):** Improve x-axis tick label readability by plotting fewer labels (e.g., one per quarter) to avoid the cramped, rotated text.\n\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   For a cleaner, more modern aesthetic, remove the top and right spines from all subplots.\n    *   Make the gridlines a lighter shade of gray and slightly thinner to make them less distracting.\n    *   Remove the shadow effect from the legend box in subplot (0,0)."
