    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Chart Selection and Layout:** Remove the pie chart (subplot (0, 0)) and the scatter plot (subplot (1, 0)) entirely. The final output should consist of only a single horizontal bar chart.\n2. **Data Sorting:** The bars in the horizontal bar chart must be sorted in descending order, with the company having the highest number of job postings at the top.\n3. **Titles and Labels:** \n   - Add a single, accurate main title, such as 'Top 15 Companies by Job Postings in the Blockchain Industry'. Make the title bold and a larger font size than other text.\n   - Correct the axis labels for the bar chart. The y-axis label should be 'Company' (or removed if the tick labels are self-explanatory), and the x-axis label should be 'Total Number of Job Postings'.\n4. **Color and Styling:**\n   - Change the chart's background to white.\n   - Make the gridlines a light gray and less prominent.\n   - Replace the harsh yellow color of the bars with a more professional, muted color like a medium blue or dark gray.\n5. **Text Formatting:** Ensure all company names on the y-axis are fully visible and legible. Adjust the left margin of the plot to provide enough space if needed."
