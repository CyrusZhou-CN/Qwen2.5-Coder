## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of the blockchain/cryptocurrency job market from 2018-2019. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Company Growth Analysis):
1. Line chart with scatter points overlay showing the number of job postings over time for the top 5 companies by total job count, with trend lines fitted to each company's trajectory
2. Stacked area chart with line overlay displaying the cumulative growth of different job categories (technical vs non-technical roles) over time, with percentage annotations
3. Bar chart with line plot overlay showing monthly hiring velocity (new jobs posted) with a 3-month moving average trend line

Middle row (Salary Evolution):
4. Box plots with violin plot overlay showing salary range distributions across quarters, with median trend line connecting the quarterly medians
5. Scatter plot with regression line showing the relationship between company funding levels and average salary offerings over time, with bubble sizes representing job volume
6. Heatmap with contour lines overlay displaying salary trends across different skill tags (top 10 most common) over monthly periods

Bottom row (Market Dynamics):
7. Histogram with KDE curve overlay showing the distribution of job posting frequencies by company size categories, with separate curves for each time period
8. Network-style bubble chart with connecting lines showing the evolution of job location preferences over time, with bubble sizes representing job counts and colors representing salary ranges
9. Dual-axis chart combining a bar chart (job count) with line charts (average salary and funding levels) to show the correlation between market activity and compensation trends over the dataset timeframe
