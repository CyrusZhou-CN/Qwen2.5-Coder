    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Task Compliance Corrections**: First, address the non-compliant chart types. In subplot (0, 2), replace the current chart with a stacked area chart for 'UV Index' and 'Visibility'. In subplot (1, 1), implement a proper calendar heatmap (e.g., using a library like `calmap` or structuring the heatmap with days of the week vs. weeks). In subplot (1, 2), add the required 'pressure line overlay'. In subplot (2, 2), replace the inset line chart with a standard cross-correlation plot showing correlation vs. lag.\n2. **Layout and Spacing**: Use `fig.suptitle('Comprehensive Weather Pattern Analysis Across Indian States', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')` to create a proper, centered main title. Then, use `plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.92, hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)` to add vertical space for the main title and increase the horizontal and vertical spacing between subplots to prevent cramping and label overlap.\n3. **Eliminate Overlap**: In subplot (2, 2), completely remove the inset chart. The corrected cross-correlation plot should be integrated cleanly, perhaps by placing the rose chart and the cross-correlation plot side-by-side within the subplot's axes if space permits, or by simplifying the visualization.\n4. **Text and Labeling**: Ensure all axes are clearly labeled with their respective units (e.g., 'Temperature (°C)', 'Visibility (km)'). Revise the ambiguous y-axis label in subplot (1, 1) from 'Temperature Pattern' to something more descriptive. Increase the font size of all axis labels and titles for better readability.\n5. **Color and Legend**: In subplot (1, 1), change the color of the overlaid scatter points to something with high contrast against all background colors, such as white with a black outline. In subplot (2, 0), select a color palette with more distinct hues (e.g., a qualitative palette from ColorBrewer) to make the different state lines easier to distinguish."
