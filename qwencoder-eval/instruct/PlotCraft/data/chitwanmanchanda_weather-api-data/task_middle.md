## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing temperature trends across different Indian states over time. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart of average daily temperatures for the top 5 most populous states, and the bottom plot shows a stacked area chart representing the temperature range (difference between max and min temperatures) for these same states over the forecast period. Use different colors for each state and include proper legends, titles, and axis labels to clearly distinguish the patterns in both absolute temperature values and temperature variability across regions.
