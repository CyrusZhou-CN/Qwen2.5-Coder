## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing temporal weather patterns across Indian states. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types: (1) Top-left: Line chart with error bands showing daily temperature trends overlaid with precipitation bars, (2) Top-center: Dual-axis plot combining humidity line chart with wind speed area chart, (3) Top-right: Stacked area chart showing UV index and visibility trends with temperature line overlay, (4) Middle-left: Time series decomposition plot showing seasonal temperature patterns with trend line and seasonal components, (5) Middle-center: Calendar heatmap of temperature variations overlaid with precipitation scatter points, (6) Middle-right: Slope chart showing temperature changes between morning and evening with pressure line overlay, (7) Bottom-left: Multi-line time series of weather conditions across top 5 most populous states with confidence intervals, (8) Bottom-center: Autocorrelation plot of temperature data combined with partial autocorrelation for weather prediction patterns, (9) Bottom-right: Cross-correlation plot between temperature and humidity overlaid with wind direction rose chart. Use different color schemes for each subplot and ensure proper temporal axis formatting with appropriate legends and annotations.
