## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing chemical clustering patterns in cosmetics data. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: A scatter plot with marginal histograms showing the relationship between ChemicalCount and number of unique companies per chemical, with points colored by PrimaryCategory and sized by reporting frequency; (2) Top-right: A parallel coordinates plot overlaid with a violin plot showing the distribution patterns of chemicals across different product categories, brand diversity, and reporting timeline spans; (3) Bottom-left: A network-style cluster plot combined with a heatmap showing chemical co-occurrence patterns in products, where nodes represent chemicals and edges represent shared products, with the heatmap showing correlation strengths; (4) Bottom-right: A dendrogram merged with a bubble chart displaying hierarchical clustering of companies based on their chemical usage profiles, with bubble sizes representing total product count and colors indicating primary category focus.
