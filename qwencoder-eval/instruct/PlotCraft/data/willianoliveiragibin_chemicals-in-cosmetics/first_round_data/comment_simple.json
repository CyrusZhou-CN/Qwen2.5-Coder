    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Adhere to Task Requirements:** The primary issue is non-compliance. The entire visualization needs to be redone as a single horizontal bar chart. Remove the pie chart completely as it was not requested and adds clutter.\n2. **Correct Chart Orientation:** Change the chart from a vertical bar chart to a horizontal bar chart. This will place the chemical names on the y-axis and the frequency counts on the x-axis, which is the standard and most effective way to display ranked categories with long labels.\n3. **Fix Text Elements:**\n    -   **Title:** Replace 'Random Data Visualization' with a descriptive title as requested, such as 'Top 10 Most Frequently Reported Chemicals in Cosmetics'.\n    -   **Axis Labels:** Label the x-axis 'Frequency Count' and the y-axis 'Chemical Name'. The horizontal orientation will naturally make the long chemical names readable.\n4. **Improve Layout and Spacing:**\n    -   Ensure there is sufficient white space around the entire chart and between the title, axes, and plot area.\n    -   Adjust the bar thickness and spacing between bars for a balanced look.\n5. **Refine Professional Formatting:**\n    -   Remove the thick black border (spines) around the plot area. Use standard, thinner axis lines.\n    -   Make the gridlines more subtle (e.g., light gray and thinner) to serve as a guide without distracting from the data bars.\n    -   For a ranking chart, using a single, solid color for all bars (e.g., a neutral blue or gray) is often more professional and effective than a multi-color gradient.\n    -   Remove the non-data annotations ('Maximum Peak Value' arrow and 'OVERLAPPING TEXT HERE')."
