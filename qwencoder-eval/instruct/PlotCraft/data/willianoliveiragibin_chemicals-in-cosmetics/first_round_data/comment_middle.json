    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's prompt. No part of the current visualization is salvageable.\n\n**1. Adhere to the Task Prompt:**\n   - **Data:** The visualization must be based on data about cosmetic products, companies, and product categories.\n   - **Layout:** Create a 1x2 layout (one row, two columns) to display the two complementary charts side-by-side.\n\n**2. Subplot 1: Stacked Bar Chart (Position (0, 0))**\n   - **Chart Type:** Use a horizontal stacked bar chart for better readability of company names.\n   - **Data:** Display the top 8 companies on the y-axis. The x-axis should represent the 'Total Product Count'.\n   - **Segmentation:** Each bar should be segmented by 'Primary Category' (e.g., Skincare, Makeup). Use a distinct, harmonious color for each category.\n   - **Labels & Title:** Label the axes clearly ('Company' and 'Total Product Count'). The title should be descriptive, such as 'Product Distribution by Category for Top 8 Cosmetic Companies'.\n   - **Legend:** Include a clear legend that maps colors to the product categories.\n\n**3. Subplot 2: Pie Chart (Position (0, 1))**\n   - **Chart Type:** Use a pie chart.\n   - **Data:** The pie chart should show the market share of each of the top 8 companies based on their product count. Each slice represents one company.\n   - **Labels & Title:** Label each slice with the company name and its percentage of the total. The title should be 'Market Share of Top 8 Companies by Product Count'.\n   - **Color Scheme:** Use a color palette that is visually distinct from the stacked bar chart but aesthetically compatible. Avoid reusing the category colors to prevent confusion.\n\n**4. Overall Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n   - **Background & Grid:** Use a clean white background with light gray, subtle gridlines on the bar chart only if necessary.\n   - **Typography:** Create a clear visual hierarchy. Use a bold, larger font for the main figure title (e.g., 'Composition of Cosmetic Products for Top 8 Companies') and a slightly smaller, regular-weight font for subplot titles.\n   - **Spacing:** Ensure adequate white space between the two subplots and around the entire figure to avoid a cramped appearance."
