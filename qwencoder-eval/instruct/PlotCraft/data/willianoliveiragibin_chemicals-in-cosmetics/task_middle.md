Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of cosmetic products by chemical content. Design a subplot with two complementary charts: (1) a stacked bar chart displaying the top 8 companies by total product count, with each bar segment colored by primary category to show the product type distribution within each company, and (2) a pie chart showing the overall market share of these top 8 companies based on their total number of reported products. Include proper legends, titles, and ensure the color schemes are consistent between both charts.
