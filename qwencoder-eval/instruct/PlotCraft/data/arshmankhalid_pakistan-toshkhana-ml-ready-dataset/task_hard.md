# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the composition and distribution patterns of Pakistan's Toshkhana gifts dataset. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top row: (1) A stacked bar chart overlaid with percentage annotations showing gift retention patterns (Retained/Not Retained/Auctioned) across different item categories, with a secondary line plot showing total gift counts per category. (2) A pie chart showing the overall composition of affiliations, combined with a donut chart in the center displaying the top 5 most frequent recipients by name. (3) A treemap showing the hierarchical composition of assessed values by item category and retention status, with bubble size representing frequency.

Middle row: (4) A stacked area chart showing the temporal composition of gift categories over years, overlaid with scatter points indicating high-value gifts (>median assessed value). (5) A horizontal stacked bar chart displaying retention cost distribution across affiliations, combined with error bars showing the standard deviation of assessed values per affiliation. (6) A waffle chart showing the proportion of gifts by retention status, overlaid with a small multiple of box plots showing assessed value distributions for each retention category.

Bottom row: (7) A combination of grouped bar charts showing average assessed values and retention costs by item category, with a secondary y-axis line plot displaying the retention rate percentage. (8) A stacked histogram showing the distribution of assessed values across different time periods (by year), with KDE curves overlaid for each retention status. (9) A radial bar chart (polar coordinates) showing the composition of gifts by month, with different colors for retention status and bar heights representing total assessed values.
