Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the composition of Pakistan's Toshkhana gifts by combining two complementary charts: (1) a stacked bar chart displaying the distribution of gift categories across different retention statuses (Retained, Not Retained, Auctioned), and (2) a pie chart showing the overall proportion of total assessed value by item category. Use different color palettes for each chart and ensure the pie chart only shows categories that represent at least 5% of the total value, grouping smaller categories as "Others".
