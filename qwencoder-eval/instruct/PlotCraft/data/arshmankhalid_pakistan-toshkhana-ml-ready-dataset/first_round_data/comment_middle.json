    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to fulfill the entire task prompt. The current output is only a small part of what was requested.\n\n1.  **Complete the Task**: Generate the missing stacked bar chart that displays the distribution of gift categories across different retention statuses (Retained, Not Retained, Auctioned).\n2.  **Create a Composite Layout**: Combine the new stacked bar chart and the existing pie chart into a single figure, likely in a 1x2 (side-by-side) layout. Add an overarching title for the entire figure, such as 'Composition of Pakistan's Toshkhana Gifts'.\n3.  **Assign Subplot Titles**: The current title 'Overall Proportion of Total Assessed Value by Item Category' should become the title for the pie chart subplot. The new stacked bar chart should have its own descriptive title, like 'Distribution of Gift Categories by Retention Status'.\n4.  **Implement Different Color Palettes**: As per the prompt, use a distinct and complementary color palette for the stacked bar chart that is different from the one used in the pie chart.\n5.  **Enhance Text Formatting**: For both subplots, make the titles bold to create a stronger visual hierarchy and improve their professional appearance."
