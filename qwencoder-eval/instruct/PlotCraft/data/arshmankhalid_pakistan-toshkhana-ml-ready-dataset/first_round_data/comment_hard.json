    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements and achieve a professional standard. The suggestions are ordered by priority:\n\n1.  **Fix Chart Types and Fulfill Requirements:** The highest priority is to regenerate the plots using the correct chart types as specified in the prompt. This includes:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2):** Replace the bubble chart with a treemap.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Change the horizontal bar chart to a *stacked* horizontal bar chart.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Use a *stacked histogram* as the base chart, then overlay the KDE curves.\n    *   **Add Missing Elements:** Incorporate all missing components, such as the donut chart in subplot (0, 1), the box plots in subplot (1, 2), and the secondary y-axis line plot in subplot (2, 0).\n\n2.  **Data Aggregation and Legend Management:** The primary cause of the layout collapse is the unmanageable number of categories in the legends for subplots (0, 0) and (2, 0). \n    *   **Aggregate Categories:** Before plotting, group the dozens of unique 'Retention Status' strings into a few meaningful, high-level categories (e.g., 'Retained', 'Auctioned', 'Displayed at PM House', 'Other'). This will make the legends concise and the stacked bars interpretable.\n\n3.  **Layout and Spacing Correction:**\n    *   **Use a Layout Manager:** Employ a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)` after plotting to automatically adjust spacing and prevent titles, labels, and plots from overlapping.\n    *   **Ensure Grid Integrity:** After fixing the legend issue, re-establish a balanced 3x3 grid with consistent spacing and subplot sizes.\n\n4.  **Text and Label Formatting:**\n    *   **Establish Hierarchy:** Make all subplot titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Improve Readability:** In subplot (2, 0), rotate the x-axis tick labels by 45 degrees and set horizontal alignment to 'right' (`ha='right'`) to prevent overlap.\n    *   **Adjust Label Padding:** Increase the padding between axis titles and tick labels in subplots (1, 1) and (2, 1) to eliminate overlap.\n\n5.  **Aesthetic and Professional Polish:**\n    *   **Consistent Color Palette:** Adopt a single, professional color palette to be used consistently across all 9 subplots for related categories (e.g., use the same color for 'Retained' in every plot where it appears).\n    *   **Clean Background:** Set the entire figure background to white, not just the individual axes areas.\n    *   **Simplify Axes:** For a cleaner, publication-ready look, consider removing the top and right spines (borders) from each subplot."
