## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing student drug addiction patterns through clustering and grouping perspectives. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Demographic Clustering Analysis
- Subplot 1: Age vs Academic Performance scatter plot with addiction risk level color coding, overlaid with cluster boundary ellipses and marginal histograms
- Subplot 2: Gender-based violin plots showing distribution of addiction scores by substance type, combined with overlaid box plots and individual data points
- Subplot 3: Family income vs peer influence bubble chart where bubble size represents addiction severity, with trend lines for different demographic groups

Row 2: Behavioral Pattern Groups  
- Subplot 4: Radar chart comparing average behavioral metrics (academic performance, social activities, family relationships) across identified addiction risk clusters, overlaid with individual student trajectories
- Subplot 5: Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of students based on substance use patterns, combined with a heatmap showing substance usage intensity by cluster
- Subplot 6: Network-style correlation matrix of addiction factors with hierarchical clustering on both axes, overlaid with significance indicators and cluster annotations

Row 3: Risk Factor Composition by Groups
- Subplot 7: Stacked area chart showing the evolution of risk factor contributions across addiction severity levels, combined with individual risk factor trend lines
- Subplot 8: Treemap of addiction triggers sized by frequency within each risk group, overlaid with connecting lines showing co-occurrence patterns
- Subplot 9: Parallel coordinates plot showing multi-dimensional profiles of high-risk vs low-risk student groups, with density curves for each dimension and group highlighting
