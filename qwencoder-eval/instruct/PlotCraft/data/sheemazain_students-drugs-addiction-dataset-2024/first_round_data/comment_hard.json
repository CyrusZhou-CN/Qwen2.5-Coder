    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical improvement is to regenerate the entire grid to comply with the task prompt, using the correct chart types and composite layers for each subplot. Assuming the current (incorrect) charts must be improved:\n\n1.  **Address Overlapping Text:** The unreadable x-axis labels are the most severe quality issue.\n    *   For subplots (1,0) 'Behavioral Metrics by Cluster' and (2,1) 'Addiction Triggers by Frequency', convert them to horizontal bar charts. This will provide ample space for the long category labels on the y-axis, making them perfectly legible.\n    *   For the correlation matrix in subplot (1,2), increase the overall figure size or the specific subplot's size to prevent the rotated labels from overlapping.\n\n2.  **Refine Subplot (0,0) 'Age vs Academic Performance':**\n    *   The current visualization is not an effective scatter plot as the y-values are binary (0 and 1). To better show the distribution, replace the current plot with a `stripplot` or `swarmplot` with added jitter to prevent points from overlapping on the y-axis.\n    *   The legend for the 'X' markers is very large and placed inside the plot area. Reduce the marker size in the legend and consider moving the legend to the outside of the plot area to avoid obscuring data.\n\n3.  **Improve Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Apply a layout adjustment function (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` in Matplotlib) to the entire figure. This will help optimize spacing, prevent titles from being too close to the plot above, and better manage the overall composition.\n\n4.  **Enhance Readability in Subplot (2,2):**\n    *   The multi-line x-tick labels are a good idea but still appear cramped. Increase the horizontal spacing (`w_space`) between subplots to give these labels more room to breathe.\n\n5.  **Add Contextual Titles:**\n    *   While titles exist, some could be more descriptive. For instance, 'PCA-based Cluster Visualization' in subplot (1,1) could be improved to 'Clustering of Student Profiles via Principal Component Analysis' to provide more context."
