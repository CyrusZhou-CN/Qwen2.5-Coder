    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign to meet the prompt's requirements. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the current area plot with a horizontal diverging bar chart (`matplotlib.pyplot.barh`). The bars should represent the deviation of each currency from the parity value of 1.0.\n2. **Data Representation:** For currencies > 1.0, bars should extend to the right. For currencies < 1.0, bars should extend to the left. Use two distinct, non-overlapping colors for these two categories.\n3. **Scatter Plot Overlay:** Add a scatter plot on the same axes. The x-position of each point should be the actual exchange rate, and the y-position should align with the corresponding currency's bar. The size of each point should be proportional to the absolute magnitude of its deviation from 1.0 (i.e., `abs(rate - 1.0)`).\n4. **Reference Line:** Add a distinct vertical dashed line at x=1.0 using `ax.axvline(x=1.0, ...)` to clearly mark the parity point.\n5. **Y-Axis Readability:** Drastically increase the vertical space of the figure (e.g., `figsize=(10, 20)`) to prevent the currency labels on the y-axis from overlapping. Ensure the font size is legible.\n6. **X-Axis Scale:** The current x-axis is dominated by a single outlier (LBP > 100,000), which makes all other data points near 1.0 impossible to distinguish. Consider using a logarithmic scale (`ax.set_xscale('log')`) to better visualize the wide range of values.\n7. **Annotations:** Correctly identify and annotate the top 3 most overvalued and top 3 most undervalued currencies. Place the text labels clearly using `ax.annotate()`, ensuring they do not overlap with each other or the data points. Use arrows if needed for clarity.\n8. **Legend:** Create a clear legend that explains the colors of the bars (Overvalued, Undervalued), the scatter plot points (e.g., 'Actual Rate'), and the parity line."
