    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Data Representation**: The most critical issue is the data. The chart must be regenerated to include bars for all of the top 15 currencies, not just one. \n2. **Sorting**: Once all 15 bars are plotted, they must be sorted in descending order from top to bottom based on their exchange rate value. \n3. **Y-Axis Labels**: The y-axis must be populated with the 15 corresponding currency codes, ensuring each bar is clearly labeled. \n4. **Layout and Spacing**: Adjust the vertical spacing between the bars to ensure they are distinct and the chart does not look cramped. The overall aspect ratio of the chart should be adjusted to properly accommodate 15 bars. \n5. **Text Formatting**: The main title, 'Top 15 Strongest Currencies Against the US Dollar', should be bolded to establish a clear visual hierarchy. \n6. **Data Labels**: Consider adding data labels at the end of each bar, formatted to two decimal places, to make the exact exchange rates easily readable without referring to the x-axis."
