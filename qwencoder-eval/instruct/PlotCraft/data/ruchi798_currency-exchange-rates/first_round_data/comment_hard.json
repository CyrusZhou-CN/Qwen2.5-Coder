    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this dashboard, several specific changes are needed:\n1.  **Overall Consistency:**\n    *   Establish and apply a single, consistent color palette for currency regions (European, Asian, etc.) across all relevant subplots, especially (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n    *   Strengthen the visual hierarchy by making the main title larger and bold, and by bolding all subplot titles.\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between the main title and the first row of subplots.\n\n2.  **Subplot-Specific Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Add the requested 30-day moving average lines for each currency and update the legend accordingly.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Correct the y-axis label to reflect 'Volatility' (e.g., 'Rolling Std. Dev.') to match the title, or change the plot to show volatility data instead of raw exchange rates.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 2):** Add the 'Seasonal' component to the plot to provide a complete seasonal decomposition as requested.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** This should be a histogram with an overlaid KDE curve. Currently, it only shows density plots. Add the underlying histograms with partial transparency so the KDE lines remain visible.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Implement the bubble chart feature by mapping trading volume to the size of the scatter points. Add a legend to explain the bubble sizes.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** This is the most critical fix. \n        *   First, correct the x-axis data and scale. The '1e6' value is an error and makes the plot unreadable. The axis should represent percentages accurately.\n        *   Second, change the chart type to a proper diverging bar chart, with bars extending left and right from a central zero baseline.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Apply the 'background area shading for volatility zones' to all currencies, not just JPY, for consistency.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** The prompt asked to compare metrics across 'different time windows'. This dimension should be added, for example by using different line styles or creating small multiples for each time window."
