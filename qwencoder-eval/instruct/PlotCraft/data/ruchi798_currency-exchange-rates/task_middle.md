# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing currency exchange rate deviations from parity (value of 1.0). Design a horizontal diverging bar chart where currencies with exchange rates above 1.0 extend to the right in one color, and currencies below 1.0 extend to the left in a different color. Overlay this with a scatter plot using the same x-axis showing the exact exchange rate values as points, with point sizes proportional to the deviation magnitude from 1.0. Include a vertical reference line at x=1.0 and annotate the top 3 most overvalued and top 3 most undervalued currencies with their exact values.
