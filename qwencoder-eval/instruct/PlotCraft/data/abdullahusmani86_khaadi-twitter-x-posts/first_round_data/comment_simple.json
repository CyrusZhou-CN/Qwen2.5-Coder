    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally flawed and cannot be salvaged. It must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's requirements. \n1. **Correct Chart Type:** Replace the bar chart and pie chart with a single line chart as requested.\n2. **Correct Data and Labels:** The chart must plot the frequency of Khaadi tweets over time. The x-axis should be labeled 'Date' and the y-axis should be labeled 'Number of Tweets' or 'Tweet Frequency'.\n3. **Add a Relevant Title:** The title should be descriptive and relevant, for example, 'Daily Tweet Frequency for Khaadi'.\n4. **Ensure Text Readability:** The x-axis date labels must be formatted and spaced properly to be legible. If there are too many dates, consider rotating the labels or plotting data at a weekly interval.\n5. **Professional Aesthetics:** Remove all nonsensical elements (the pie chart, the incorrect legend). Use a simple, professional color palette, such as a single shade of blue for the line. Ensure the title is bold and larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy. The layout should be balanced, utilizing the available space effectively without excessive white space."
