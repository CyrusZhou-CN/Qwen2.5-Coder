    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the following specific actions are recommended:\n\n1.  **Complete Missing Visualizations:** The primary issue is incompleteness. Re-generate the following subplots to include all required components:\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Implement a proper histogram for tweet length, overlay the KDE curve, and add the requested box plot (e.g., below the main plot).\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Re-do the analysis to show the frequency of the *top N hashtags* over time, not the number of hashtags per tweet. Add trend lines for these top hashtags.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 2):** Add the 'percentage change indicators' to the stacked bars.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Add marginal distribution plots (histograms or bar plots) to the top and right of the heatmap to show tweet counts by hour and day of the week, respectively.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2):** Add the 'violin plot distributions' for different time periods alongside the line chart to show the spread of sentiment scores.\n\n2.  **Resolve Text Overlap and Formatting:**\n    *   **Subplots (0, 2) and (1, 2):** Rotate the x-axis tick labels by 45 or 90 degrees to prevent overlap. Alternatively, reduce the number of ticks displayed by showing only one label per year.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Format the y-axis tick labels to a reasonable precision (e.g., '0.004') instead of the long float.\n    *   **General:** Establish a stronger typographic hierarchy. Increase the font size and weight of the main figure title (if one were added) and ensure subplot titles are clearly distinct from axis labels.\n\n3.  **Enhance Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** The bars are nearly invisible. Increase their width and change their color to one with much higher contrast against the white background (e.g., a medium gray or blue).\n\n4.  **Improve Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the vertical and horizontal spacing between subplots to prevent titles from crowding the plots above them and to create a more balanced, less cramped appearance. Using a function like `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)` would help."
