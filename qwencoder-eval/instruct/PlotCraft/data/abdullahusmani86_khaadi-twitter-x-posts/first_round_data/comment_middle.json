    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to fix the data processing for the bottom chart. (1) **Data Correction**: Re-aggregate the data for subplot (1, 0) to correctly calculate and display the tweet frequency for all seven days of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday). (2) **Text Formatting**: In both subplots (0, 0) and (1, 0), make the titles bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy. (3) **Layout Refinement**: Adjust the overall figure's aspect ratio to reduce the excessive vertical whitespace and create a more compact and visually balanced layout. (4) **Visual Element Refinement**: In subplot (0, 0), consider reducing the size of the markers on the line chart or removing them entirely to reduce visual clutter, as the density of data points is high. In subplot (1, 0), once all seven bars are plotted, ensure they have appropriate widths and spacing for clear differentiation. (5) **Gridlines**: Make the gridlines in both plots more subtle (e.g., lighter gray, dashed line style) to ensure they support the data without being distracting."
