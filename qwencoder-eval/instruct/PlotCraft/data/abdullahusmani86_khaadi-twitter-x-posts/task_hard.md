# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal patterns and content evolution of Khaadi's Twitter posts. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): 
1. Daily tweet frequency as a bar chart overlaid with a 7-day rolling average line plot
2. Weekly posting patterns showing both count bars and cumulative percentage line
3. Monthly trend analysis with tweet volume bars and engagement intensity heatmap overlay

Middle row (3 subplots):
4. Tweet length distribution histogram with overlaid KDE curve and box plot summary statistics
5. Hashtag usage frequency over time as stacked area chart with trend lines for top hashtags
6. Content category evolution showing stacked bars for different post types with percentage change indicators

Bottom row (3 subplots):
7. Seasonal posting behavior with polar/radar chart overlaid on circular time series
8. Day-of-week vs hour-of-day posting heatmap with marginal distribution plots
9. Content sentiment timeline combining line chart trends with violin plot distributions for different time periods

Each composite subplot must integrate at least two different visualization techniques and reveal insights about how Khaadi's social media strategy, content focus, and posting patterns have evolved over the dataset's timeframe.
