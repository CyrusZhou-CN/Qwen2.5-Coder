## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal patterns of Khaadi's Twitter activity. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart of daily tweet counts over time, and the bottom plot shows a bar chart of tweet frequency by day of the week. Parse the date column to extract temporal information, aggregate the data appropriately, and ensure both plots are properly labeled with titles, axis labels, and legends where applicable.
