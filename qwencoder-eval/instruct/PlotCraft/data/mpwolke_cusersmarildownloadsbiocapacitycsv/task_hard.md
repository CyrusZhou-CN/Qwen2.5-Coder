## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing biocapacity patterns across countries and land use types. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Scatter plot with marginal histograms showing the relationship between total biocapacity and forest products biocapacity, with countries colored by continent/region clusters; (2) Stacked bar chart overlaid with line plot showing top 10 countries by total biocapacity with individual land use components stacked and a line showing data quality scores; (3) Radar chart combined with box plots showing biocapacity profiles for different country clusters (high, medium, low total biocapacity).

Middle row: (4) Treemap overlaid with bubble chart showing hierarchical composition of global biocapacity by country size, with bubbles representing cropland efficiency ratios; (5) Parallel coordinates plot combined with density curves showing multi-dimensional biocapacity profiles across all land use types, with density distributions for each dimension; (6) Network-style cluster plot with violin plots showing country groupings based on biocapacity similarity, with violin distributions for each cluster.

Bottom row: (7) Heatmap combined with dendrogram showing hierarchical clustering of countries based on normalized biocapacity profiles across all land use types; (8) Grouped bar chart with error bars showing mean biocapacity by continent/region clusters with confidence intervals and individual country distributions; (9) Correlation matrix heatmap overlaid with scatter plots in upper triangle showing pairwise relationships between all biocapacity land use types.

Parse the semicolon-separated data format, handle the decimal comma notation, and ensure each subplot reveals distinct clustering patterns and relationships within the global biocapacity landscape.
