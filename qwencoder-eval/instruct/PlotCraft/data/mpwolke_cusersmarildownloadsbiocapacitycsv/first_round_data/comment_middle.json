    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart fails to meet the prompt's requirements on every level and needs to be completely recreated. \n1.  **Layout**: Change the layout from the current 1x2 (horizontal) to the requested 2x1 (vertical) arrangement.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top Chart**: \n    *   Replace the vertical bar chart with a **horizontal bar chart**.\n    *   Plot the top 15 countries by biocapacity. Countries should be on the y-axis and biocapacity values on the x-axis.\n    *   Order the bars from top to bottom, starting with the country with the highest biocapacity.\n    *   Replace the rainbow color scheme with a professional, single-hue sequential palette (e.g., shades of blue).\n    *   Change the title to 'Top 15 Countries by Total Biocapacity'.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom Chart**:\n    *   Replace the pie chart with a **lollipop chart**.\n    *   Plot the bottom 15 countries by biocapacity. Countries should be on the y-axis and biocapacity values on the x-axis.\n    *   Order the lollipops from top to bottom, starting with the country with the lowest biocapacity.\n    *   Use a different color scheme from the top chart to create contrast (e.g., shades of orange).\n    *   Change the title to 'Bottom 15 Countries by Total Biocapacity'.\n4.  **Text and Labels**: \n    *   Replace the main title with one that reflects the task, such as 'Biocapacity Extremes: Top and Bottom 15 Countries'.\n    *   Ensure all x-axes are correctly labeled as 'Total Biocapacity (global hectares)' and y-axes show country names.\n5.  **Formatting**: \n    *   Use a white background for the entire figure.\n    *   If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines) and only on the x-axis to aid value comparison."
