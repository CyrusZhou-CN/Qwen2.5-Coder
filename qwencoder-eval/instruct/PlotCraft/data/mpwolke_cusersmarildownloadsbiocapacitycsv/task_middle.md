# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization with two subplots arranged vertically (2x1 layout). The top subplot should display a horizontal bar chart ranking the top 15 countries by their total biocapacity (in global hectares), with countries ordered from highest to lowest biocapacity. The bottom subplot should show a lollipop chart of the bottom 15 countries by total biocapacity, also ordered from lowest to highest. Both charts should use different color schemes to distinguish between high-capacity and low-capacity countries, and include appropriate titles and axis labels. Add a main title that compares the biocapacity extremes across countries.
