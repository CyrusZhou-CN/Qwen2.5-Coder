# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between property prices and location characteristics in the UAE real estate market. Design a scatter plot with price on the y-axis and bedrooms on the x-axis, where each point is colored by the number of bathrooms and sized by a derived metric (price per bedroom). Overlay this scatter plot with a trend line showing the correlation between bedrooms and price. Additionally, add marginal plots: a histogram on the right side showing the distribution of prices, and a box plot at the top showing price distribution across different bedroom counts.
