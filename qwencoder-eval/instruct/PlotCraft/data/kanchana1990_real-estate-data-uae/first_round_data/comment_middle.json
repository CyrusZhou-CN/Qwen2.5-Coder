    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Rebuild the Layout:** The entire chart needs to be reconstructed as a proper joint plot. The top box plot (subplot (0,0)) and the right histogram (subplot (1,1)) must be perfectly aligned with the main scatter plot (subplot (1,0)), sharing their respective x and y axes. Eliminate the large gaps between the plots to create a single, integrated visualization.\n2. **Correct the Box Plot:** The top box plot must be changed to show multiple box plots, one for each unique value on the 'Number of Bedrooms' x-axis. This is essential to fulfill the prompt's requirement of showing 'price distribution across different bedroom counts'.\n3. **Add the Missing Trend Line:** Overlay a linear regression trend line on the main scatter plot to visualize the correlation between 'Number of Bedrooms' and 'Price (AED)' as requested.\n4. **Fix the X-Axis:** The x-axis for both the scatter plot and the top box plot must be corrected to display the full range of bedroom counts in the data, not just the single value '3'. This is a critical error that makes the chart uninterpretable.\n5. **Refine Text and Titles:** Consolidate the titles into one main title for the entire figure (e.g., 'Relationship Between Price and Bedrooms in UAE Properties'). The current bold font for all text is overpowering; use a standard font weight for axis labels and ticks to create a better visual hierarchy.\n6. **Address Data Representation:** The data points on the scatter plot are heavily stacked vertically at x=3. Consider adding a small amount of horizontal 'jitter' to the points to better visualize their density. Also, either remove or explain the single anomalous red data point."
