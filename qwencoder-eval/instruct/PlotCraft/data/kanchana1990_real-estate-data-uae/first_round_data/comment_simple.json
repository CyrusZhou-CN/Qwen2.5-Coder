    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete recreation from scratch. \n1. **Start Over:** Discard the current visualization entirely.\n2. **Use the Correct Chart Type:** Generate a single histogram to show the data distribution, not a bar chart or a pie chart.\n3. **Use Correct Data and Labels:** The chart must visualize the 'property prices in the UAE real estate dataset'.\n   - Set the main title to something informative, like 'Distribution of Property Prices in the UAE'.\n   - Label the x-axis 'Property Price (AED)' and the y-axis 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n4. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a clean, white background for the chart.\n   - If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines).\n   - Choose a single, professional color for the histogram bars, such as a muted blue or gray. Avoid neon colors and harsh, contrasting outlines.\n   - Remove all non-informative and unprofessional text like 'WOW!' and nonsensical legends like 'Glarbnok's Revenge'.\n5. **Bin Sizing:** Adjust the number of bins in the histogram to properly reveal the shape of the price distribution. Start with a default value (e.g., 30-50 bins) and adjust as needed to balance detail and clarity."
