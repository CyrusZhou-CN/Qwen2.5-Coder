    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure to comply with the prompt and must be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Start Over:** Discard the current visualization entirely. \n2. **Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single line chart in a 1x1 layout. \n3. **Data:** Plot the closing prices for RELIANCE, TCS, and INFY on the y-axis against the date (from 2015 to 2020) on the x-axis. All three lines should be on this single chart. \n4. **Formatting and Professionalism:** \n   - Use a professional theme with a white background and light gray, non-intrusive gridlines. \n   - Set a clear and accurate main title, such as 'Closing Price Trends of NSE Stocks (2015-2020)'. The title should be bold and have a larger font size than other text. \n   - Label the x-axis 'Date' and the y-axis 'Closing Price (INR)'. \n   - Format the y-axis tick labels to represent Indian Rupees (e.g., '₹1,000' or '1,000 INR'). \n5. **Colors and Legend:** \n   - Use a professional and distinct color palette for the three lines (e.g., dark blue, orange, and green). Avoid neon or overly bright colors. \n   - Add a legend to a clear space (e.g., the top-right corner) that correctly maps each color to its corresponding stock (RELIANCE, TCS, INFY). \n6. **Annotations:** To fulfill the 'highlight trends' requirement, add annotations or callout boxes to point out significant price movements (e.g., a major rally or a sharp decline) for any of the stocks during the specified period."
