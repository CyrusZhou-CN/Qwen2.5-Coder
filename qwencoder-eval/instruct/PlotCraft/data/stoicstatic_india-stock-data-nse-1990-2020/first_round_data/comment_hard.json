It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n1.  **Start Over:** The entire visualization needs to be rebuilt based on the prompt. Load the correct NSE stock data for RELIANCE, TCS, and INFY from 1990-2021.\n2.  **Layout:** Create a proper 3x3 subplot grid using `plt.subplots(3, 3)`. Ensure consistent sizing and spacing.\n3.  **Professional Formatting:** Immediately switch to a professional, publication-ready style. Use a white background (`plt.style.use('default')` or similar), remove the dark theme, and use subtle gray gridlines.\n4.  **Top Row (Subplots (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)):** For each stock, create a combined line chart for closing price and an area chart for 30-day rolling volatility. Add the requested error bands. Use clear titles like 'RELIANCE: Price & Rolling Volatility'.\n5.  **Middle Row (Subplots (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)):** For each stock, create a dual-axis chart. Use `mplfinance` or a similar library for candlestick patterns on the primary axis (showing the last 2 years). Plot volume as a bar chart on the secondary axis (`twinx()`). Overlay the 50-day moving average on the price data. Label both y-axes clearly (e.g., 'Price (INR)', 'Volume').\n6.  **Bottom Row (Subplots (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)):** For each stock, perform and plot a time series decomposition, showing the original series and the trend component. Identify and highlight days with >5% price changes using scatter points, and connect them with lines to show volatility clustering.\n7.  **Text and Annotations:** Ensure all titles and axis labels are correct and descriptive. Use a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., bold titles). Add annotations (e.g., using `ax.axvspan` or `ax.text`) to mark the 2008 and 2020 market events as requested.\n8.  **Color and Legends:** Assign a unique and consistent color to each stock (e.g., blue for RELIANCE, purple for TCS, orange for INFY) and use it across all three rows. Ensure each subplot has a clear, non-obstructive legend."
