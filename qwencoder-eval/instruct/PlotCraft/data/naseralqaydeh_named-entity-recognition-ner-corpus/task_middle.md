Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the distribution of named entity types in the NER corpus. First, extract and count all entity types from the Tag column (excluding 'O' tags), then create a subplot with two charts: (1) a pie chart displaying the proportion of each entity type (geo, org, per, gpe, tim, art, eve, nat), and (2) a horizontal bar chart showing the exact counts of each entity type, sorted from highest to lowest frequency. Use different color palettes for each chart and include percentage labels on the pie chart.
