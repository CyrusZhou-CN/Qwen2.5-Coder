## Instruction
Create a pie chart showing the distribution of different named entity types in the NER corpus. Parse the Tag column to extract all individual NER tags, count the frequency of each entity type (geo, org, per, gpe, tim, art, eve, nat), and visualize their relative proportions. Exclude 'O' tags (non-entities) from the visualization and display percentages for each entity type on the chart.
