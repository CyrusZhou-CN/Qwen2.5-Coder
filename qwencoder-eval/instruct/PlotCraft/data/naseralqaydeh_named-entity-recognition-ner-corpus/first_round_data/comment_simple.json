    "improvement_suggestions": "The entire visualization needs to be regenerated from scratch to meet the prompt's requirements. \n1. **Remove the Bar Chart:** The primary issue is the presence of the incorrect and unrequested horizontal bar chart. The final output should only contain the pie chart.\n2. **Correct the Title:** Replace the nonsensical titles ('Weather Forecast', 'Glarbnok's Revenge') with a single, descriptive title for the pie chart, such as 'Distribution of Named Entity Types in NER Corpus'.\n3. **Adopt a Professional Theme:** Switch from the dark theme to a professional standard with a white background. This will greatly improve readability and formal appearance.\n4. **Improve the Color Palette:** Replace the current jarring neon colors with a more professional and harmonious categorical color palette. Consider using a muted or pastel color scheme to ensure visual appeal and clear differentiation between slices without causing eye strain.\n5. **Ensure Data Correctness:** While the pie chart percentages appear plausible, the data labels on the bar chart are fundamentally incorrect. The regeneration process must ensure all text and data representations are accurate.\n6. **Refine Layout:** The final chart should be a single, centered pie chart with a clear title at the top. Ensure the percentage labels on the pie slices are legible and do not overlap."
