    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Task Adherence**: First and foremost, follow the prompt. The goal is to visualize the distribution of named entity types.\n2. **Layout Refinement**: Change the layout from 3x1 to 1x2 (one row, two columns) to place the pie and bar charts side-by-side for easy comparison.\n3. **Correct Chart Types**: In subplot (0, 0), generate a pie chart. In subplot (0, 1), generate a horizontal bar chart.\n4. **Data and Text Content**: Use the actual NER corpus data. The title should be relevant, such as 'Distribution of Named Entity Types'. The pie chart slices should be labeled with entity types (geo, org, etc.) and their corresponding percentages. The horizontal bar chart's y-axis should list the entity types, and the x-axis should represent the 'Count'.\n5. **Sorting**: The horizontal bar chart in subplot (0, 1) must be sorted in descending order, with the entity type having the highest count at the top.\n6. **Professional Formatting**: \n   - **Background and Grid**: Use a white background. If gridlines are necessary on the bar chart, make them light gray and non-intrusive.\n   - **Color Scheme**: Replace the current color scheme with professional palettes. Use a distinct, qualitative color palette for the pie chart slices. For the bar chart, use a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue) for all bars to focus on the length comparison.\n   - **Typography**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy. Make the main title bold and larger than the axis labels. Ensure all text is horizontal for readability.\n7. **Clarity and Spacing**: Ensure there is no overlap between any elements. Adjust plot margins and spacing between the two subplots to create a balanced and clean final image."
