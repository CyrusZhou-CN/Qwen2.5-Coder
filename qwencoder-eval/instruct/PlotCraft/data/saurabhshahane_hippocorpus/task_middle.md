## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals how different demographic groups (age, gender, race) cluster around memory types and psychological factors. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A grouped bar chart showing the distribution of memory types (recalled, imagined, retold) across different age groups, with bars colored by gender; (2) Top-right: A parallel coordinates plot connecting annotatorAge, openness, importance, and frequency variables, with lines colored by memType to show how these psychological dimensions vary across memory types; (3) Bottom-left: A violin plot showing the distribution of openness scores across different racial groups, with separate violins for each memory type; (4) Bottom-right: A bubble chart where x-axis is importance, y-axis is frequency, bubble size represents openness, and bubble color represents different combinations of gender and race, to reveal multi-dimensional clustering patterns in the psychological space.
