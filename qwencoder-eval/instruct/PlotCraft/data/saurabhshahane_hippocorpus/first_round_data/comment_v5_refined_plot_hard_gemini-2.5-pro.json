    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart suffers from a fundamental layout failure that must be addressed before any other improvements can be made. The suggestions are ordered by priority:\n\n1.  **Implement a 3x3 Subplot Grid:** The primary issue is the lack of a proper grid. Use a plotting library function like Matplotlib's `fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(...))` to create a 3x3 array of axes. Each of the nine plots must be explicitly drawn on its corresponding axes object (e.g., `axes[0, 0]` for the top-left plot, `axes[1, 2]` for the middle-right, etc.).\n\n2.  **Generate All Missing Plots:** The treemap (for subplot (2, 1)) and the network plot (for subplot (2, 2)) are completely missing. These must be generated and placed in their correct positions within the newly created grid.\n\n3.  **Manage Layout Spacing:** After placing all plots in the grid, use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)` to automatically adjust the spacing between subplots. This will prevent titles, axis labels, and other elements from overlapping between adjacent plots.\n\n4.  **Correct Title Hierarchy:** The main title, 'Comprehensive Analysis of Clustering Patterns...', should be set as a single figure-level super-title using `fig.suptitle()`. Each of the nine subplots should then be given its own concise, descriptive title using `ax.set_title()` (e.g., `axes[0, 0].set_title('Openness vs. Importance')`). The current method of stacking multiple long titles is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Reposition and De-clutter Elements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 2) - Heatmap:** Ensure the heatmap, its dendrograms, and its color bar are all contained within the boundaries of the `axes[1, 2]` cell. Currently, it is floating incorrectly in the bottom-right of the canvas.\n    *   **Legends:** Consolidate legends where possible. For instance, instead of multiple 'Memory Type' legends, consider creating a single, shared legend for the entire figure and placing it in an empty space or below the grid to save space within the subplots.\n\n6.  **Final Readability Check:** Once the layout is fixed, review the font sizes of all titles, axis labels, and tick labels to ensure they are legible and appropriately scaled for their respective subplots."
