The following steps outline how to correctly build the visualization as requested:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the current pie chart with a **grouped bar chart**.\n    *   **X-axis:** Should represent the different age groups.\n    *   **Y-axis:** Should represent the count or proportion.\n    *   **Grouping:** For each age group, create bars for each memory type ('recalled', 'imagined', 'retold').\n    *   **Color:** Color the bars by 'gender'.\n    *   **Text:** Add a clear title (e.g., 'Memory Type Distribution by Age and Gender') and a legend for the gender colors.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the scatter plot with a **parallel coordinates plot**.\n    *   **Axes:** Create four parallel vertical axes for 'annotatorAge', 'openness', 'importance', and 'frequency'.\n    *   **Lines:** Draw lines connecting the values of each data point across the four axes.\n    *   **Color:** Color the lines based on 'memType'.\n    *   **Text:** Add a title (e.g., 'Psychological Dimensions Across Memory Types') and a legend for the memory type colors.\n\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the scatter plot with a **violin plot**.\n    *   **X-axis:** Should represent the different racial groups.\n    *   **Y-axis:** Should represent the 'openness' scores.\n    *   **Grouping:** For each racial group, create separate violins for each 'memory type'.\n    *   **Text:** Add a title (e.g., 'Distribution of Openness by Race and Memory Type') and a legend for the memory types.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the unreadable line chart with a **bubble chart**.\n    *   **X-axis:** 'importance'.\n    *   **Y-axis:** 'frequency'.\n    *   **Size:** The size of each bubble should be mapped to the 'openness' variable.\n    *   **Color:** The color of each bubble should represent the combination of 'gender' and 'race'.\n    *   **Text:** Add a title (e.g., 'Clustering of Psychological Factors') and clear legends for both bubble size and color.\n\n5.  **Overall Formatting:**\n    *   Set the background of the entire figure and all subplots to white.\n    *   If gridlines are used, make them light gray and non-intrusive.\n    *   Ensure all titles are bolded and descriptive, and all axis labels are correct and legible.\n    *   Adjust the layout (`tight_layout` or `constrained_layout`) to ensure there is no overlap between subplots and their titles/labels."
