    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Simplify Layout:** Remove the entire top scatter plot ('Unicorn Distribution'). The final output should be a single 1x1 plot containing only the histogram.\n2. **Correct All Text:**\n   - **Title:** Change to 'Distribution of Work Completion Times'.\n   - **X-axis Label:** Change from 'Number of Writers' to 'Work Completion Time (seconds)'.\n   - **Y-axis Label:** Change from 'Seconds of Completion' to 'Frequency' or 'Count of Writers'.\n3. **Improve Color Scheme:**\n   - Replace the neon green bar fill with a more professional, muted color like steel blue or dark gray.\n   - Change the bright red bar outline to a darker shade of the fill color or remove it.\n   - Change the bright yellow, dashed median line to a solid, dark red or black line for better visibility and a more professional look.\n4. **Enhance Annotation and Legend:**\n   - Remove the irrelevant legend ('Zlorp Value') entirely.\n   - Change the color of the median annotation text ('Median: 686') from cyan to black or white to ensure high contrast against the bar color.\n   - Position the annotation text slightly above or to the side of the median line to prevent any overlap.\n5. **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a white background for the chart area.\n   - If gridlines are necessary, make them thin and light gray to be less distracting.\n   - Ensure the main title is bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
