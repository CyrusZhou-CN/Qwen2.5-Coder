    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete recreation from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single 1x1 plot. Use `plt.plot()` twice on the same axes to generate two distinct lines for 'Nominations' and 'Wins'. Do not use bar or scatter plots.\n2. **Data and Content:** The entire dataset and all text elements must be replaced. The chart should visualize Oscar nominations and wins for Best Director from 1930-2019.\n3. **Text Formatting:**\n   - **Title:** Change the title to something descriptive, like 'Oscar Nominations and Wins for Best Director (1930-2019)'. Make it bold and slightly larger than other text for clear hierarchy.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Set the x-axis label to 'Year' and the y-axis label to 'Count'.\n   - **Legend:** Implement a proper legend that correctly labels the two lines as 'Nominations' and 'Wins'.\n   - **Annotations:** Remove all nonsensical annotations like 'Winners?' and 'Nom Nomz'.\n4. **Color Scheme:** Replace the harsh neon green and other clashing colors with a professional, harmonious palette. For example, use a solid blue line for nominations and a dashed orange line for wins to ensure clarity and accessibility.\n5. **Professional Standards:**\n   - Use a white background for the chart.\n   - If gridlines are used, make them light gray and thin to be unobtrusive.\n   - Remove the heavy, dark tick marks and use standard, lighter-weight ticks."
