    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the task requirements. \n\n1.  **Data and Content**: The primary issue is the data. The chart must be generated using data for Oscar Best Director awards from 1927 to 2019. All titles, labels, and data points must reflect this topic.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type**: \n    *   Implement the correct 2x1 layout (two rows, one column).\n    *   In the top subplot (0, 0), create a **line chart** showing the total number of nominations per decade.\n    *   In the bottom subplot (1, 0), create a **stacked area chart** showing the proportion of winners vs. other nominees for each decade.\n3.  **Titles and Labels**: \n    *   Add a main title for the entire figure, such as 'Oscar Best Director Awards: Trends from 1927-2019'.\n    *   Title the top subplot (0, 0) 'Total Nominations per Decade' and label its axes 'Decade' and 'Number of Nominations'.\n    *   Title the bottom subplot (1, 0) 'Proportion of Winners vs. Nominees' and label its axes 'Decade' and 'Proportion (%)'.\n4.  **Aesthetics and Formatting**: \n    *   Use a professional and consistent color scheme across both plots. A simple palette using shades of blue or gray, with a distinct color like gold to highlight winners, would be effective. Avoid rainbow palettes and black backgrounds.\n    *   Ensure a clean, white background for the entire visualization.\n    *   Use subtle, light-gray gridlines if needed, or remove them to reduce clutter.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy for text: make the main title largest and bold, followed by subplot titles, then axis labels and tick labels."
