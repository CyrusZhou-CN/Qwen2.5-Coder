## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the trend of Oscar nominations and wins for Best Director over time from 1930 to 2019. Plot two separate lines on the same chart: one for the total number of nominations per year and another for the number of winners per year. Use different colors and line styles to distinguish between nominations and wins, and include a legend. Add appropriate axis labels and a title that reflects the temporal analysis of Oscar recognition patterns.
