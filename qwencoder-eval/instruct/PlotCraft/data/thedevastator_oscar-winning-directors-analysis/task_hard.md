Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Oscar Best Director awards from 1930-2019. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Line chart with area fill showing total nominations per decade overlaid with bar chart showing winner counts per decade, (2) Stacked area chart showing nomination vs winner proportions over time with trend line overlay, (3) Dual-axis plot combining line chart of cumulative winners over years with scatter plot of individual winning years sized by decade.

Middle row: (4) Histogram of directors' winning frequency with KDE overlay and box plot showing distribution statistics, (5) Time series line chart of award ceremonies per year with moving average trend line and highlighted peak years as scatter points, (6) Combination of violin plot showing year distribution of nominations with strip plot overlay showing individual data points.

Bottom row: (7) Slope chart connecting nomination counts to winner counts across decades with area chart background showing total awards volume, (8) Multi-line time series showing running totals of nominations and winners with confidence interval bands, (9) Composite chart combining bar chart of unique directors per decade with line plot showing repeat winner trends and scatter overlay marking notable directors.

Each subplot must include appropriate titles, legends, and annotations highlighting key insights about the temporal evolution of Oscar directing recognition patterns.
