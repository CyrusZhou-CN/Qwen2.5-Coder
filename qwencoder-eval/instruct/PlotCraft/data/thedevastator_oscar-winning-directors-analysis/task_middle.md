## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of Oscar Best Director awards over time from 1927 to 2019. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart tracking the total number of nominations per decade, and the bottom plot shows a stacked area chart illustrating the proportion of winners versus nominees over the same time periods. Both charts should highlight temporal trends and patterns in Academy Award recognition for directors across nearly a century of cinema history.
