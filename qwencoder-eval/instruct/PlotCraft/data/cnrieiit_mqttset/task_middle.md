## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the MQTT sensor network structure and attack patterns. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where: (1) The top subplot displays a network diagram showing the spatial distribution of sensors across the two rooms, with nodes sized by their communication frequency (periodic vs random) and colored by sensor type, connected to the central MQTT broker; (2) The bottom subplot shows a grouped bar chart comparing the distribution of different attack types (SlowITe, Bruteforce, Malformed data, Flooding, DoS attack) across the legitimate traffic baseline, with each attack type represented as a separate group and bars showing the relative frequency or impact severity.
