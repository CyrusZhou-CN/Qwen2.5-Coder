# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Groups

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive network security analysis dashboard using a 2x2 subplot grid. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Create a grouped bar chart showing attack type distribution across different rooms, overlaid with a line plot showing the temporal trend of attacks per hour; (2) Top-right: Generate a scatter plot of sensor IP addresses vs attack frequency with bubble sizes representing attack severity, combined with a box plot showing attack distribution by sensor type; (3) Bottom-left: Design a stacked area chart displaying the cumulative attack patterns over time for each attack category (SlowITe, Bruteforce, Malformed data, Flooding, DoS), with error bands showing confidence intervals; (4) Bottom-right: Construct a radar chart comparing attack characteristics across different sensor types, overlaid with a heatmap showing correlation patterns between attack types and sensor vulnerabilities.
