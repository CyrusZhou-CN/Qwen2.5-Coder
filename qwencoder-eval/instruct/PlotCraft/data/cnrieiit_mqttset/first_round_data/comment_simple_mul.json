    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is that a pie chart is not suitable for visualizing this dataset due to the extreme imbalance in proportions. \n1. **Change Chart Type**: The most effective improvement would be to switch to a horizontal bar chart. This would give each category, no matter how small, its own distinct bar, allowing for clear labels and easy comparison. The bars should be sorted from largest to smallest percentage.\n2. **Improve Labeling (if Pie Chart is mandatory)**: If you must use a pie chart, the labels for the small, overlapping slices must be moved outside the chart and connected with leader lines (callouts). This would prevent them from overlapping and make them readable. The external category labels should also be repositioned to eliminate overlap.\n3. **Group Small Slices**: Another strategy for a pie chart is to group all the small malicious categories into a single 'Malicious Traffic' slice and use an 'explode' effect to separate it slightly from the main 'legitimate' slice. A separate bar chart or table could then be used to detail the composition of the 'Malicious Traffic' category.\n4. **Enhance Legend Colors**: To improve the legend, assign distinct shades of red (or a different color palette) to each of the five malicious attack types. This would make the legend more informative, even if the slices themselves are too small to see the color difference clearly."
