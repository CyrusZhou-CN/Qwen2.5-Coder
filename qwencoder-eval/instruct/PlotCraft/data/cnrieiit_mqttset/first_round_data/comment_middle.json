    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following changes are necessary:\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Change the layout from the current 1x2 (side-by-side) to the required 2x1 (top and bottom) arrangement.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Network Diagram:**\n    *   **Add Connections:** Draw lines (edges) from each sensor node (S1-S6) to the central 'Broker' node to complete the network diagram.\n    *   **Add Legend:** Include a legend to explain the meaning of node colors (e.g., 'Magenta: Type A Sensor', 'Green: Type B Sensor') and sizes (e.g., 'Size indicates communication frequency').\n    *   **Correct Title:** Change the title from 'Banana Distribution Map' to something appropriate, like 'MQTT Sensor Network Layout'.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Grouped Bar Chart:**\n    *   **Correct Text:** Replace all incorrect text. The title should be 'Attack Type Distribution' instead of 'Sensor Banana Attacks'. The Y-axis label should be 'Event Count' or 'Frequency' instead of 'Banana Count'. The X-axis label should be 'Attack Type' instead of 'Severity Level'.\n    *   **Improve X-Axis Ticks:** Spell out the full names for the attack types on the x-axis (e.g., 'SlowITe', 'Bruteforce', 'Malformed Data') for better clarity.\n4.  **Overall Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   **Color Palette:** Replace the harsh neon colors with a professional, harmonious color palette. Use more subdued, distinct colors for the nodes and a standard color pair (e.g., blue and orange) for the bars.\n    *   **Professional Standards:** Set the chart background to white. If gridlines are used, make them thin and light gray. Create a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title and subplot titles bold and larger than the axis labels."
