    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet task requirements. The following changes are needed to achieve compliance and improve the visualization:\n\n1.  **Fulfill Task Requirements (Chart Types)**:\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Add density curves along each vertical axis of the parallel coordinates plot to show the distribution of values for each feature.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: This subplot needs to be completely redone. Create a network graph with nodes representing the broker and sensors. Use edges to show connections, and modulate the edge color or thickness based on the communication frequency from the heatmap data. The current plot is only a heatmap and is missing the required network graph visualization.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: Replace the current time series plot with a proper time series decomposition plot. This should have three panels showing the trend, seasonal, and residual components for both the 'Legitimate Traffic' and 'Malicious Traffic' series.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: Add the required hierarchical clustering dendrogram. This should be placed either above or to the left of the scatter plot, with the dendrogram's leaves aligned with the corresponding clusters in the scatter plot to show their hierarchical relationship.\n\n2.  **Visual and Textual Refinements**:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: The line connecting two points is not an effective representation of a 'rate'. Replace the line plot with either a second set of bars on a secondary y-axis or distinct data points (e.g., large circles) to represent the success rate for each category. Also, change the x-axis label from 'Attack Type' to 'Traffic Type' for accuracy.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Use a more vibrant and distinct color palette for the lines in the parallel coordinates plot to improve the traceability of individual sensor patterns.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: Clarify the y-axis label. If 'Traffic Volume' can be negative due to normalization or differencing, relabel it to 'Normalized Traffic' or 'Traffic Anomaly Score' to avoid confusion.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: The data points are heavily overlapped. Use a smaller marker size or apply transparency (alpha blending) to better reveal the density and distribution of points within the clusters."
