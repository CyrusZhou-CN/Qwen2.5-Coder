    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this dashboard, several changes are needed for both task compliance and visual quality:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Add the required box plot to visualize the attack distribution by sensor type. This could be integrated alongside the y-axis or as a smaller inset plot.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Revise the data to show the specified attack categories: 'SlowITe', 'Bruteforce', 'Malformed data', 'Flooding', and 'DoS'. The current categories ('DoS Attacks', 'Legitimate Traffic') do not match the prompt.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the text box with the required heatmap overlay on the radar chart to visualize correlation patterns between attack types and sensor vulnerabilities. Ensure all sensor types listed in the legend are distinctly plotted.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Drastically reduce the font size of the main title, 'Network Security Analysis Dashboard', to eliminate the overlap with subplot titles. Center it cleanly above the grid.\n    *   **Spacing:** Increase the vertical spacing (`hspace`) between the top and bottom rows of subplots to create more breathing room and prevent titles and labels from clashing.\n\n3.  **Text and Formatting:**\n    *   **Hierarchy:** Establish a clear and consistent text hierarchy. The main title should be largest, followed by subplot titles, then axis labels, and finally tick labels. Use consistent font sizes and weights for similar elements across all subplots.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** The y-axis label 'Attack Count' is disproportionately large and bold; reduce its size to match other axis labels.\n\n4.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the red and green colors with a colorblind-safe palette, such as blue and orange, or purple and teal, to improve accessibility."
