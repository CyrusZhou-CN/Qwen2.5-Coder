    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, focus on fulfilling the task requirements and refining the professional presentation. \n1. **Complete the Visualizations:** The highest priority is to implement all missing chart components as specified in the prompt: add the bubble plot to (0,1), the parallel coordinates plot to (0,2), replace the box plot with a violin plot (with an overlaid box plot) in (1,0), add autocorrelation plots to (1,2), add marginal bar charts to the confusion matrix in (2,0), and add the treemap to the dendrogram in (2,2). \n2. **Standardize Color Scheme:** Define a single, consistent color palette for all attack types ('malformed', 'dos', 'legitimate', etc.) and apply it uniformly across subplots (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (2,1). This is critical for enabling viewers to track categories across the entire dashboard. \n3. **Improve Layout and Spacing:** Use a layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust`) to create even, balanced spacing between all subplots. Reduce the excessive vertical gap between rows to create a more cohesive grid. Adjust the aspect ratio of individual plots to better fit their content, such as making the dendrogram (2,2) wider and less tall. \n4. **Enhance Text Clarity:** \n   - **Subplot (0,0):** Fix the broken legend. Clarify the right y-axis label ('Total Intensity') to be more specific. Add more space between the plot and the legend/secondary axis to prevent cramping. \n   - **Subplot (0,1):** Ensure the title ('Packet Size vs Frequency') aligns with the axis labels. Change the axes to 'Packet Size' and 'Frequency' respectively. \n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Use more descriptive x-axis tick labels instead of the current long, rotated ones. \n   - **Subplot (2,0):** Remove the redundant subtitle 'Feature-Attack Combinations'. \n5. **Refine Individual Plots:** \n   - **Subplot (0,2):** The radar chart is sparse. If data exists for other categories, plot them. If not, remove the unused categories from the legend. Increase the line width for better visibility. \n   - **Subplot (1,1):** Reposition the color bar for better aesthetics, perhaps making it slightly thicker and giving it more padding. \n   - **General:** Ensure all titles are descriptive and all axes are clearly and accurately labeled."
