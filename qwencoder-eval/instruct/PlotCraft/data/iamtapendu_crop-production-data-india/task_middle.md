## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing crop production trends over time in India. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a line chart showing the total production across all crops for each year from 2000-2007, and the bottom plot shows a stacked area chart displaying the seasonal contribution (Kharif, Rabi, etc.) to total production over the same time period. Both plots should clearly show how crop production patterns have evolved temporally and reveal any seasonal dependencies in India's agricultural output.
