## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing crop production trends over time in India. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Temporal Production Analysis
- Subplot 1: Line chart showing total production trends over years with overlaid bar chart showing number of crops grown each year
- Subplot 2: Stacked area chart showing production by season over time with trend lines for each season
- Subplot 3: Dual-axis plot with line chart for average area cultivated and bar chart for production efficiency (production/area ratio) by year

Row 2: Seasonal and Regional Dynamics
- Subplot 4: Grouped bar chart showing production by season for each year with overlaid line showing seasonal variation coefficient
- Subplot 5: Heatmap showing crop production by year and district with marginal bar plots showing total production per year and per district
- Subplot 6: Multiple line charts showing top 5 crops' production trends over time with confidence bands

Row 3: Productivity and Efficiency Analysis
- Subplot 7: Scatter plot of area vs production for each year with regression lines and bubble sizes representing number of crop types
- Subplot 8: Box plots showing production distribution by year with overlaid violin plots and mean trend line
- Subplot 9: Slope chart connecting production values between consecutive years for top crops with diverging color coding for increase/decrease

Include proper titles, legends, and annotations highlighting key insights about India's agricultural evolution over the time period.
