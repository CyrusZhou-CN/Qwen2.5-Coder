    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to implement a stacked area chart in the bottom subplot. To fix this, the following changes are essential: (1) In subplot (1, 0), change the chart type from a simple area chart to a stacked area chart. Each season should be represented as a distinct layer. (2) For subplot (1, 0), apply a qualitative color palette with distinct, harmonious colors for each season to allow for clear differentiation. The current single gray color makes the chart unreadable. (3) Correct the legend for subplot (1, 0) by removing the duplicate entries for 'Kharif' and 'Rabi'. Each season should be listed only once. (4) For better comparability, align the y-axis scales of both subplots. Since the top of the stacked area chart should equal the total production line, setting the y-axis limits to be the same (e.g., 0 to 9000) for both subplot (0, 0) and (1, 0) would make the visualization more intuitive. (5) Consider slightly reducing the font size of the main titles for both subplots to create a more balanced visual hierarchy with the plot content."
