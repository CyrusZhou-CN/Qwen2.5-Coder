Ranking

## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 political parties ranked by their total vote count across all constituencies. Calculate the total votes received by each party by summing up the 'Total Votes' for all candidates belonging to that party. Display the party names on the y-axis and total vote counts on the x-axis, with bars ordered from highest to lowest vote count. Add appropriate title, axis labels, and format the vote counts with comma separators for better readability.
