## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the clustering and grouping patterns in the 2024 Indian Lok Sabha election results. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Party performance clusters using a scatter plot of vote percentage vs total votes with party-colored points overlaid with density contours, (2) Top-center: State-wise party dominance using a stacked bar chart combined with a line plot showing average vote percentages, (3) Top-right: Constituency competitiveness groups using a violin plot of vote percentages by result status overlaid with individual data points, (4) Middle-left: Vote distribution clusters using a 2D histogram of EVM vs Postal votes with marginal density plots, (5) Middle-center: Party coalition analysis using a network-style correlation heatmap of party co-occurrence patterns overlaid with hierarchical clustering dendrogram, (6) Middle-right: Winner vs runner-up margin analysis using a dumbbell plot combined with a histogram of victory margins, (7) Bottom-left: Regional voting behavior using parallel coordinates plot for top 5 parties across different states with density ribbons, (8) Bottom-center: Candidate performance tiers using a treemap of vote shares nested within party groups combined with a radar chart overlay, (9) Bottom-right: Electoral competitiveness zones using a cluster scatter plot of constituencies grouped by vote concentration metrics with convex hull boundaries around each cluster.
