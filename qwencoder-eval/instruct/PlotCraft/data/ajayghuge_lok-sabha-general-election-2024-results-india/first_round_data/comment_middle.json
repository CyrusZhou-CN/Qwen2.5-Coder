    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Data Representation**: The most critical issue is the incorrect data in the bar chart (subplot (0, 0)). The 'Total Vote Percentage' values and the x-axis scale must be corrected to reflect a valid 0-100% range. The summary text box in the top-left corner should be corrected or removed.\n2. **Fulfill Composite Chart Requirement**: The primary instruction was to overlay the plots. This could be achieved by plotting the scatter points directly onto the corresponding bars of the horizontal bar chart. For example, each party's bar would serve as the y-position, while the x-axis could represent the 'Number of Constituencies Contested' for the scatter points.\n3. **Resolve Label Overlap**: In the scatter plot (subplot (0, 1)), use a text repulsion algorithm to reposition the party labels so they do not overlap. Ensure full party names are displayed without truncation.\n4. **Improve Layout Spacing**: Increase the horizontal space (`wspace`) between the two subplots to prevent the y-axis label of the scatter plot from overlapping the legend of the bar chart.\n5. **Enhance Legends**: The legend for the scatter plot (subplot (0, 1)) is incomplete. It should either include all parties with their corresponding colors or be removed entirely since the points are already labeled directly. If keeping the bar chart legend, consider moving it to a less cluttered area, such as above the plot, to improve clarity."
