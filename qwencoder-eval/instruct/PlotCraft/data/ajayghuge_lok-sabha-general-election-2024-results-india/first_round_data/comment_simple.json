    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct the X-Axis:** The most critical issue is the x-axis. It must be replaced with a proper numerical scale. The ticks should represent round numbers (e.g., 0, 50,000,000, 100,000,000, etc.) and the labels should be formatted for readability, either with comma separators or using scientific notation/abbreviations (e.g., '50M', '100M'). The current implementation is completely incorrect.\n2. **Reorder the Bars:** The bars must be reordered to comply with the prompt. The party with the highest vote count ('Communist Party of India (Marxist)' in this chart) should be at the top, and the party with the lowest count ('Bharatiya Janata Party') should be at the bottom.\n3. **Improve Visual Hierarchy:** Make the main title 'Top 10 Political Parties Ranked by Total Vote Count' bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear typographic hierarchy.\n4. **Add Data Labels:** To improve clarity, add data labels at the end of each bar showing the precise total vote count. These labels should be formatted with comma separators (e.g., '235,973,933').\n5. **Incorporate Gridlines:** Add light gray, subtle vertical gridlines to help the user's eye connect the end of each bar to the corresponding value on the x-axis.\n6. **Adjust Layout Spacing:** Increase the left margin to provide more white space between the edge of the figure and the long y-axis labels (party names), improving overall balance and readability."
