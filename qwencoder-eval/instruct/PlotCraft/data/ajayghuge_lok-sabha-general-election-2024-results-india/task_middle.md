## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the top 10 political parties by total vote share in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The visualization should consist of a horizontal bar chart displaying each party's total vote percentage, with bars colored by party affiliation, and overlay this with a scatter plot showing the number of constituencies each party contested (x-axis) versus their average vote percentage per constituency (y-axis). Add appropriate labels, title, and a legend to distinguish between the bar chart and scatter plot elements.
