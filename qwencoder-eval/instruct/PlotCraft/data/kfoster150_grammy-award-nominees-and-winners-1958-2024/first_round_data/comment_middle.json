    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is completely incorrect and must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Data Correction:** Discard all current data and use a dataset detailing Grammy Award categories from 1958 to 2024.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:**\n    *   Create a 2x1 layout (two subplots stacked vertically).\n    *   In subplot (0, 0) (the top one), create a **line chart**, not a bar chart. The X-axis should be 'Year' (1958-2024) and the Y-axis should be 'Total Number of Categories'.\n    *   In subplot (1, 0) (the bottom one), create a **stacked area chart**. The X-axis should be 'Year' or 'Decade', and the Y-axis should be 'Cumulative Number of Categories'. The different colored areas should represent distinct families of awards (e.g., Pop, Rock, Country).\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Change the main title to something relevant, like 'Evolution of Grammy Award Categories (1958-2024)'.\n    *   For subplot (0, 0), title it 'Total Categories Per Year' and label axes 'Year' and 'Number of Categories'.\n    *   For subplot (1, 0), title it 'Cumulative Growth of Award Types' and label axes 'Year' and 'Number of Categories'.\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   Use a white background for the entire figure. Remove the black background and the harsh red borders.\n    *   Use subtle, light gray gridlines instead of bright white ones.\n    *   Adopt a professional and harmonious color palette (e.g., a sequential or qualitative palette from ColorBrewer) for the stacked area chart. Use a single, neutral color like dark blue or gray for the line chart.\n5.  **Annotations and Legends:**\n    *   Add a clear legend for the stacked area chart to identify the award families.\n    *   On the line chart, add 2-3 text annotations with arrows to highlight key periods of change, as requested in the prompt (e.g., pointing to the 1990s and adding text like 'Significant category expansion')."
