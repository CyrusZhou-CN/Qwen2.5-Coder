Make the title bold and slightly larger than other text.\n   - Ensure axis labels are correct ('Year' for x-axis, 'Number of Categories' for y-axis).\n   - Add clear and legible tick labels to both axes at appropriate intervals (e.g., every 5 or 10 years on the x-axis).\n   - Use a single, neutral color (e.g., blue, gray, or black) for the line plot.\n   - If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray and thin) to avoid distracting from the data line."
