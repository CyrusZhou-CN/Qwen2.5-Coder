## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of Grammy Award categories over time. Design a subplot with two charts: (1) a line chart displaying the total number of award categories per year from 1958 to 2024, and (2) a stacked area chart showing the cumulative growth of different award types (based on Award Name patterns like "Best", "Album", "Song", etc.) over the decades. Use different colors to distinguish award type families and add trend annotations to highlight significant periods of category expansion in Grammy history.
