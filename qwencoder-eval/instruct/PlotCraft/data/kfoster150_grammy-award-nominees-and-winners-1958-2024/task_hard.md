## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Grammy Awards from 1958-2024. Each subplot must combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top row (Award Categories Evolution): 
- Subplot 1: Stacked area chart showing the number of awards per major category over time, overlaid with a line plot showing total awards per year
- Subplot 2: Dual-axis plot combining a bar chart of new award categories introduced each decade with a line plot showing cumulative award categories
- Subplot 3: Heatmap showing award category density by decade, overlaid with scatter points indicating peak years for each category

Middle row (Winner vs Nominee Analysis):
- Subplot 4: Time series line plot showing the ratio of winners to total nominees per year, combined with a filled area chart showing the absolute number of nominees
- Subplot 5: Violin plot showing the distribution of nominees per award category across different decades, overlaid with box plots for statistical summary
- Subplot 6: Scatter plot with trend lines showing the relationship between ceremony number and average nominees per award, with different colors for different award types

Bottom row (Temporal Patterns):
- Subplot 7: Calendar heatmap showing Grammy ceremony intensity by month/year, combined with marginal histograms showing seasonal and yearly distributions
- Subplot 8: Slope chart connecting the top 10 most frequent award categories between the first and last decades, overlaid with error bars showing variability
- Subplot 9: Multi-layered time series decomposition showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of total Grammy nominations, with each component as a separate line plot within the same subplot
