# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the composition and distribution patterns of the 20 newsgroups dataset. In the top-left subplot, create a treemap showing the hierarchical composition of newsgroups by their main categories (comp, rec, sci, misc, talk, alt, soc) with each rectangle sized by document count and colored by category. In the top-right subplot, combine a stacked bar chart showing document distribution across categories with an overlaid line plot indicating the cumulative percentage. In the bottom-left subplot, create a waffle chart (10x10 grid) where each square represents approximately 1% of total documents, with different colors for each main category. In the bottom-right subplot, combine a pie chart showing the proportion of each main category with a nested donut chart in the center displaying the top 5 individual newsgroups by document count. Add appropriate titles, legends, and annotations to highlight the compositional insights across all four visualizations.
