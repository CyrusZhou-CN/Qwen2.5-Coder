# Visualization Task - Middle

Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the distribution of newsgroup documents across different categories. First, create a horizontal bar chart displaying the count of documents for each of the 20 newsgroups, sorted in descending order. Then, overlay a pie chart (as an inset) in the upper right corner that groups the newsgroups into their main categories (comp, rec, sci, misc, talk, alt, soc) and shows the proportion of documents in each category. Use different color schemes for the bar chart and pie chart to clearly distinguish between the two visualizations.
