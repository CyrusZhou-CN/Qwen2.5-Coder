# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart that ranks teams by their average boost collection efficiency across all matches. Calculate the boost collection efficiency as the ratio of boost amount collected to boost collection attempts (boost_count_collected_big + boost_count_collected_small). Use the matches_by_teams.csv file to get team-level boost statistics and the main.csv file to filter for specific event information. Display the top 10 teams with the highest boost collection efficiency, showing team names on the y-axis and efficiency values on the x-axis. Add data labels showing the exact efficiency values rounded to 2 decimal places.
