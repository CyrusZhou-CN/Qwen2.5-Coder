Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between boost management and team performance in Rocket League matches. The visualization should consist of two subplots: 1) A scatter plot showing the correlation between average boost amount collected per team and their core score, with points colored by match outcome (winner/loser) and sized by total shots taken, and 2) A scatter plot examining the relationship between boost collection efficiency (boost_amount_collected divided by boost_time_zero_boost) and shooting percentage, with a fitted regression line overlaid to show the trend.
