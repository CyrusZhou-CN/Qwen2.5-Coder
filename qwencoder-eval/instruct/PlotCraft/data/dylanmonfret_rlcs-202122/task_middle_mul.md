# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis dashboard using a 2x2 subplot grid to examine the relationships between player performance metrics and team success in Rocket League Championship Series matches. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top-left: Create a scatter plot with regression line showing the correlation between individual player core_score and team match wins, overlaid with a marginal histogram showing the distribution of core_score values.

Top-right: Generate a bubble plot where x-axis represents boost_avg_amount, y-axis represents positioning_percent_offensive_third, bubble size represents core_goals, and color represents whether the player's team won the match.

Bottom-left: Construct a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between key performance metrics (core_shots, core_goals, core_saves, boost_bpm, movement_time_supersonic_speed, positioning_time_offensive_third) with annotated correlation coefficients.

Bottom-right: Design a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) focusing on three variables: core_shooting_percentage, advanced_rating, and demo_inflicted, with different colors for winning vs losing teams and trend lines for each group.
