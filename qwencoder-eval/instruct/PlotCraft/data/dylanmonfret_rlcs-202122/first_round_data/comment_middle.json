    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul as it fails to meet the task requirements on nearly every level. \n\n1.  **Start Over:** Discard the current chart entirely and regenerate it from scratch, strictly following the prompt.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:**\n    *   Create a 2x1 layout with two subplots, not three. Remove the pie chart.\n    *   The top subplot (0, 0) should be a scatter plot.\n    *   The bottom subplot (1, 0) should also be a scatter plot, but with a single regression line overlaid. Use a function like `seaborn.regplot` to achieve this correctly, instead of connecting all points.\n3.  **Data Encoding and Legends:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):**\n        *   Set the x-axis to 'Average Boost Amount Collected' and the y-axis to 'Core Score'.\n        *   Color the points based on 'Match Outcome' (winner/loser) using two distinct, professional colors (e.g., blue and orange). Add a legend to identify the colors.\n        *   Size the points based on 'Total Shots Taken'. Add a note or legend entry to explain the sizing.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):**\n        *   Set the x-axis to 'Boost Collection Efficiency' and the y-axis to 'Shooting Percentage'.\n        *   Ensure only a single regression line is plotted over the scatter points to show the trend.\n4.  **Text Content:**\n    *   Replace all nonsensical titles and labels with accurate and descriptive text. For example:\n        *   Overall Title: 'Relationship Between Boost Management and Team Performance'\n        *   Subplot (0, 0) Title: 'Team Score vs. Boost Collected by Match Outcome'\n        *   Subplot (1, 0) Title: 'Shooting Percentage vs. Boost Efficiency'\n    *   Remove all parenthetical and confusing text like '(Wrong)' and '(Actually...)'.\n5.  **Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n    *   Switch to a professional, publication-ready style with a white background and black text.\n    *   If using gridlines, make them light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data.\n    *   Use a professional and harmonious color palette. Avoid neon colors entirely.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title larger and/or bold compared to subplot titles and axis labels."
