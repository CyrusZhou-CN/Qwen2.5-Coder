    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Fix Task Non-Compliance:**\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** This must be changed from a scatter plot to a network graph. Nodes should represent players, and edges should be drawn between them to show connections. Node size should be mapped to `advanced_rating` and color to `team_id`.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** A hierarchical clustering dendrogram must be overlaid on the bubble chart to show team relationships.\n   - **Subplot (2, 0):** Dendrograms must be added to both the rows and columns of the heatmap to visualize the hierarchical clustering of metrics.\n   - **Annotations:** Add text boxes or annotations near each relevant subplot to explain the clustering method used (e.g., 'K-Means Clustering (k=3)', 'Agglomerative Clustering').\n\n2. **Layout and Spacing:**\n   - **Main Title:** Move the main title 'Rocket League Championship Series...' completely above the subplot grid to eliminate the overlap. Increase its font size to establish it as the primary title.\n   - **Spacing:** Drastically reduce the vertical whitespace between the rows to create a compact, unified dashboard. Use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` for automatic and consistent spacing.\n   - **Legend Placement:** Relocate the legend for subplot (0, 1) from the far right to a more integrated position, such as the top-right corner inside the plot area or directly below the plot, to fix the layout imbalance.\n\n3. **Text and Readability:**\n   - **Treemap Labels (2, 1):** Improve the readability of text within the treemap. Either implement an algorithm to adjust font size based on rectangle area or remove labels from rectangles that are too small to contain them legibly.\n   - **Axis Labels:** For the parallel coordinates plot (1, 1) and heatmap (2, 0), ensure the rotated labels do not overlap and are clearly legible. Consider using shorter abbreviations if possible.\n\n4. **Color Scheme:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Select two visually distinct colors for 'Asia-Pacific South' and 'Asia-Pacific North' to ensure they can be easily differentiated.\n   - **Dashboard Cohesion:** To fulfill the 'consistent color schemes' requirement, establish a base color palette to be used across all plots. For example, the team cluster colors from the parallel coordinates plot could be used for the team colors in the network graph."
