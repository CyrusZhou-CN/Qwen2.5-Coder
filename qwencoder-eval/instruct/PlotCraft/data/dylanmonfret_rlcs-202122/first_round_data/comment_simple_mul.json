    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Layout and Chart Type:** Remove the pie chart at subplot (1, 0) entirely. Change the chart at subplot (0, 0) from a vertical bar chart to a horizontal bar chart as requested.\n2. **Fix Axes and Sorting:** In the horizontal bar chart, place team names on the y-axis and 'Average Boost Collection Efficiency' on the x-axis. Sort the bars so the team with the highest efficiency is at the top.\n3. **Improve Text Elements:**\n   - **Title:** Change the title to 'Top 10 Teams by Boost Collection Efficiency'. Make it bold and increase its font size for emphasis.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Add a clear x-axis label. The y-axis label ('Team Names') can be removed as the ticks are self-explanatory.\n   - **Tick Labels:** Ensure the team names on the y-axis are horizontal and have sufficient spacing to be fully readable.\n   - **Data Labels:** Change the color of the data labels from yellow to black or dark gray for better readability. Position them just to the right of each bar's end.\n4. **Refine Visual Formatting for Professionalism:**\n   - **Background and Grid:** Use a white background. Employ subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines only; remove the vertical ones.\n   - **Bar Styling:** Remove the thick red border from the bars. Use a single, more muted color (e.g., a medium blue or steel gray) for all bars.\n   - **Spines:** Remove the top and right chart borders (spines) to create a cleaner, more modern look."
