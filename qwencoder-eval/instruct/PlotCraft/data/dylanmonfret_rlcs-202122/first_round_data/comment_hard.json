    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to regenerate the charts to match the complex composite types specified in the prompt. Assuming that is addressed, the following visual refinements are needed:\n\n1.  **Layout and Title:**\n    -   The main title ('Rocket League Championship Series...') must be moved above the entire grid of subplots to prevent any overlap. Use a dedicated function like `fig.suptitle()` for this.\n    -   Reduce the font size of the main title by at least 50% to make it proportional to the rest of the figure.\n    -   Use a layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)`) to ensure consistent and adequate spacing between the main title and all subplots.\n\n2.  **Text Formatting and Hierarchy:**\n    -   Make all nine subplot titles bold to distinguish them from axis labels and establish a clear hierarchy within the grid.\n    -   In the network graph at subplot (0, 2), increase the font size of the node labels and use a text repulsion algorithm to prevent them from overlapping.\n\n3.  **Color and Legend Consistency:**\n    -   Establish a single, consistent color palette for team clusters and apply it across all relevant subplots, including (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 1). For instance, if 'Cluster 1' is red in the first plot, it should be red in all others.\n    -   For the radar chart at subplot (1, 2), move the legend to a more integrated position, such as below the subplot title, to improve proximity to the data it describes.\n\n4.  **Data and Plot Element Corrections:**\n    -   The box plot at subplot (1, 0) is missing the 'Offensive' category shown on its x-axis. This data should be included to complete the chart.\n    -   The scatter plot at subplot (2, 0) is incorrectly titled 'Team Performance Hierarchy'. The title should be changed to accurately reflect its axes, such as 'Core Score vs. Advanced Rating'."
