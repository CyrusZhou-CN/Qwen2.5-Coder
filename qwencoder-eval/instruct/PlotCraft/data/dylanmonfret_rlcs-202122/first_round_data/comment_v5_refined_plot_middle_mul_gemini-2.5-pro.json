    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical improvement is to fulfill the user's prompt by creating the requested 2x2 dashboard with all four specified subplots. The current output only addresses one of the four requirements.\n\nFor the single generated plot (the scatter plot matrix, which was intended for subplot (1, 1)):\n1.  **Add Titles:** A main title for the entire figure is essential, for example: 'Analysis of Player Performance Metrics by Match Outcome'.\n2.  **Reduce Overplotting:** In the scatter plots, especially the one showing 'Rating' vs 'Shooting %', the data points are heavily overlapped. Consider reducing the point size or applying a small amount of jitter to better reveal the distribution of data.\n3.  **Refine Aesthetics:** The thick black spines around each subplot are visually heavy. Use a function like `seaborn.despine()` to remove the top and right spines for a cleaner, more modern aesthetic that is common in publications.\n4.  **Improve Legend:** The legend title 'Team Result' is adequate, but 'Match Outcome' could be slightly more descriptive.\n5.  **Axis Ticks:** The axis tick labels are quite small relative to the large, bold axis titles. Increasing their font size slightly would improve overall readability and balance."
