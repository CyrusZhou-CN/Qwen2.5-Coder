    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be completely redone from scratch. The current output is unsalvageable.\n\n1.  **Start Over with the Correct Chart Type:** Discard the current bar and pie charts. Create a single histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'core_score' column.\n2.  **Correct Data Representation:** The x-axis must represent the 'core_score' values, and the y-axis must represent the frequency (count) of occurrences within each bin.\n3.  **Implement Task Requirements:**\n    *   Ensure the histogram is generated with exactly 15 bins as specified in the prompt.\n    *   Set an appropriate and descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Player Core Scores'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Core Score'.\n    *   Label the y-axis as 'Frequency' or 'Number of Players'.\n4.  **Improve Layout and Formatting:**\n    *   Use a standard 1x1 layout with a single subplot.\n    *   Adopt a professional and clean visual style. A white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines is recommended for clarity.\n    *   Choose a single, professional color for the histogram bars (e.g., a standard blue, gray, or teal) instead of the harsh neon green.\n    *   Ensure all text (title, labels) is clearly legible with high contrast against the background (e.g., black or dark gray text on a white background).\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
