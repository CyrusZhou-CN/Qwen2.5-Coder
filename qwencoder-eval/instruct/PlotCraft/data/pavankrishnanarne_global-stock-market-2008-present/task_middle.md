## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of global stock market performance during major financial crises. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays overlapping line charts of normalized closing prices (scaled to start at 100) for three major indices (S&P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225) from 2008-2012 to capture the 2008 financial crisis and recovery period. The bottom plot should show a stacked area chart displaying the cumulative trading volume trends for the same three indices over the same time period. Both plots should include clear crisis period annotations and use distinct colors for each market to highlight how different global markets responded to and recovered from the financial crisis.
