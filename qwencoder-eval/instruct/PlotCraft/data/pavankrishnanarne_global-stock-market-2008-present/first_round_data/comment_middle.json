    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Layout and Structure:** Change the layout from 1x3 to the specified 2x1 grid. Remove the third subplot ('Unicorn Index') entirely. \n2. **Chart Types:** In the top subplot (0, 0), replace the scatter plot with a line chart to show trends. In the bottom subplot (1, 0), replace the stacked bar chart with a stacked area chart for cumulative volume. \n3. **Data and Text:** Replace all placeholder data with the actual financial data for S&P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225 from 2008-2012. Update all text elements: \n    - Add a main title like 'Global Stock Market Performance During the 2008 Financial Crisis'.\n    - Subplot (0, 0) title: 'Normalized Closing Prices (Indexed to 100)'.\n    - Subplot (1, 0) title: 'Cumulative Trading Volume'.\n    - X-axis labels for both plots: 'Year'.\n    - Y-axis label for subplot (0, 0): 'Normalized Price'.\n    - Y-axis label for subplot (1, 0): 'Trading Volume'.\n    - Update the legend to correctly identify the three indices.\n4. **Annotations:** Add annotations to both plots, such as a shaded vertical region, to clearly mark the 2008 financial crisis period. \n5. **Aesthetics:** \n    - Adopt a professional color palette with distinct, non-neon colors (e.g., blue, orange, green).\n    - Change the chart background to white.\n    - Use subtle, light gray gridlines to avoid distracting from the data.\n    - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than other text elements."
