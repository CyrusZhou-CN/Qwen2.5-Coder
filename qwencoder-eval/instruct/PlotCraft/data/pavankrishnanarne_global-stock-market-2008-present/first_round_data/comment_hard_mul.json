    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several changes are required for both task compliance and visual quality:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Implement the scatter plot overlay to show daily volume spikes as requested.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the area chart on the secondary y-axis with a bar chart to represent average daily trading volume.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** Visualize the major market drawdown periods using line charts or shaded regions, not a single, static horizontal red line.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** This subplot needs to be completely redone. Create a heatmap of the monthly returns correlation matrix as the primary visual, and then add the line plot for the market synchronization index as specified.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the overall figure size and use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)`) to create adequate spacing and prevent all overlaps.\n    *   Add significant vertical padding between the main figure title and the first row of subplots.\n    *   Increase the horizontal (`wspace`) and vertical (`hspace`) spacing between all subplots to reduce clutter.\n\n3.  **Text and Annotations:**\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** Add the missing text labels ('US', 'Europe', 'Asia') to the legend.\n    *   **Annotations:** For the 'Lehman Crisis' and 'COVID-19' annotations, use horizontal text with an arrow pointing to the corresponding vertical line. This is far more readable than rotated text.\n    *   **Titles:** Ensure subplot titles do not overlap with the main title and have enough space to wrap cleanly if necessary.\n\n4.  **Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Select a color palette with better contrast for the line charts. Avoid light yellows and oranges that are hard to see against a white background.\n    *   **Borders:** Lighten the color and reduce the weight of the black borders (spines) around each subplot for a cleaner, more professional appearance."
