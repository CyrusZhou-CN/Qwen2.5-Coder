    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several critical changes are needed:\n\n1.  **Global Adjustments:** Increase the overall figure size and use a constrained layout (`constrained_layout=True` in matplotlib) to automatically adjust spacing and prevent titles and labels from overlapping.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - US Market Performance:**\n    -   **Data Correction:** The volatility band must be calculated for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) as specified in the prompt, not the NYSE Composite (^NYA). Update the legend accordingly to read '^GSPC Volatility Bands'.\n    -   **Clutter Reduction:** This is a 'spaghetti plot'. To improve clarity, highlight the main index (e.g., ^GSPC) with a thicker, more prominent line and color. Render the other indices with thinner lines and/or semi-transparent colors to de-emphasize them.\n    -   **Y-Axis Check:** The y-axis extends to negative values for a price index normalized to 100. This is likely an error in data processing or plotting; the y-axis should start at or near 0.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Asian Markets:**\n    -   **Chart Correction:** This plot is broken. It must be re-rendered as a proper grouped bar chart. Ensure the bar widths and spacing are set correctly so that bars for each market are visible side-by-side for each year.\n    -   **X-Axis Labels:** Rotate the x-axis tick labels by 45 degrees (`plt.xticks(rotation=45)`) to prevent them from overlapping.\n    -   **Data Range:** Fix the x-axis scaling issue that causes all data to be compressed on the left side. The plot should utilize the full width of the subplot area.\n    -   **Legend:** Complete the legend for the secondary y-axis (volume) to include all four Asian markets, not just two.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Regional Market Cap:**\n    -   **Annotations:** This is the strongest subplot. Enhance it by adding direct text annotations for the 'Crisis Periods' markers (e.g., text saying '2008 Financial Crisis' next to the 2008-2009 markers and 'COVID-19 Crash' next to the 2020 marker).\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Correlation Matrix:**\n    -   **Layout Redesign:** The overlay design is ineffective. The line plot should be separated from the heatmap. A better design would be to place the line plot in a smaller subplot directly above the heatmap, sharing the x-axis, to show the trend over time independently.\n    -   **Task Interpretation:** Since plotting a heatmap for each year is impossible in a static chart, the title of the heatmap should be changed to clarify what it represents, for example: 'Average Annual Inter-Market Correlation (2008-2023)'.\n    -   **Axis for Line Plot:** If the overlay is kept (not recommended), a secondary y-axis must be added on the right and labeled 'Average Correlation' so the line plot can be interpreted."
