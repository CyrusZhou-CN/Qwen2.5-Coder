## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of global stock market performance from 2008-2023. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Create a multi-line time series plot showing the normalized closing prices (scaled to start at 100 in 2008) for major US indices (^NYA, ^IXIC, ^DJI, ^GSPC) overlaid with a filled area chart showing the volatility bands (calculated as 30-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns) for the S&P 500.

Top-right: Develop a dual-axis combination chart displaying the annual average closing prices of Asian markets (^NSEI, ^BSESN, ^N225, 000001.SS) as grouped bar charts on the primary y-axis, with a line plot overlay showing the annual trading volume trends for these same markets on the secondary y-axis.

Bottom-left: Construct a stacked area chart showing the relative market capitalization contribution of different regional market groups (US: ^NYA+^IXIC+^DJI+^GSPC, Europe: ^FTSE+^N100, Asia: ^NSEI+^BSESN+^N225+000001.SS) over time, with scatter points overlaid to highlight major market crash and recovery periods (2008-2009, 2020 COVID impact).

Bottom-right: Build a correlation heatmap matrix showing the annual correlation coefficients between all major indices for each year from 2008-2023, combined with a line plot showing the average cross-market correlation trend over the 15-year period, highlighting periods of market convergence and divergence.
