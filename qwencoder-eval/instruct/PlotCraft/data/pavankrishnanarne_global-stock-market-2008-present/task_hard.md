## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of global financial markets from 2008-2023. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques to reveal temporal patterns and relationships:

Top row (2008-2010 Crisis Period): 
- Subplot 1: Overlay line charts of S&P 500 (^GSPC) and NASDAQ (^IXIC) closing prices with a dual-axis bar chart showing their daily volume ratios
- Subplot 2: Combine area charts of FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and Nikkei 225 (^N225) closing prices with scatter points highlighting days where both indices moved in opposite directions
- Subplot 3: Create a time series decomposition plot showing Gold Futures (GC=F) trend line overlaid with Crude Oil Futures (CL=F) volatility bands (using rolling standard deviation)

Middle row (2011-2016 Recovery Period):
- Subplot 4: Dual-axis combination of Indian markets - line chart of BSE SENSEX (^BSESN) with overlaid candlestick patterns for Nifty 50 (^NSEI) during high volatility periods
- Subplot 5: Stacked area chart showing the relative performance of European markets (^FTSE, ^N100) with a superimposed line showing their correlation coefficient over time
- Subplot 6: Multi-layered time series showing Dow Jones (^DJI) closing prices with error bands representing daily price ranges, overlaid with volume-weighted moving averages

Bottom row (2017-2023 Modern Period):
- Subplot 7: Combine heatmap-style calendar visualization of Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) returns with overlaid trend lines showing quarterly performance patterns
- Subplot 8: Multi-axis plot showing synchronized movements between NYSE Composite (^NYA) and commodity futures (Gold and Oil) with cross-correlation indicators
- Subplot 9: Advanced time series plot combining all major US indices (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC, ^NYA) normalized to show relative performance, with regime change detection markers and volatility clustering visualization
