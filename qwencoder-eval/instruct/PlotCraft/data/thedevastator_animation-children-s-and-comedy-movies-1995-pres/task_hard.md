## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Animation, Children's, and Comedy movies from 1995 to present. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Genre Evolution Analysis):
- Subplot 1: Stacked area chart showing the cumulative count of movies by year, overlaid with a line plot showing the total annual movie count
- Subplot 2: Bar chart displaying genre combination frequencies, overlaid with a scatter plot showing the average release year for each genre combination
- Subplot 3: Histogram of movie releases by year with a KDE curve overlay, plus error bars showing confidence intervals

Middle row (Temporal Distribution Patterns):
- Subplot 4: Box plot showing the distribution of release years for different genre combinations, overlaid with violin plots for density visualization
- Subplot 5: Heatmap showing the correlation between years and genre popularity, combined with a line plot tracking the diversity index of genres over time
- Subplot 6: Dual-axis plot with a bar chart showing annual movie counts and a line chart showing the rolling 3-year average trend

Bottom row (Comparative Trend Analysis):
- Subplot 7: Multiple line plots showing the trend of each major genre combination over time, overlaid with shaded confidence bands
- Subplot 8: Slope chart comparing early period (1995-2005) vs recent period (2015-present) genre distributions, combined with dot plots showing individual data points
- Subplot 9: Time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of movie release patterns, with multiple overlapping trend lines for different genre categories
