    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements and professional standards.\n1.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the entire visualization. Create a 2x1 layout with no excessive spacing. The top subplot (0, 0) must be a line chart showing movie counts per year. The bottom subplot (1, 0) should be the stacked area chart showing genre proportions.\n2.  **Text Content:**\n    *   Add a relevant main title, such as 'Movie Release Trends and Genre Proportions (1995-Present)'.\n    *   For the line chart (0, 0), label the x-axis 'Year' and the y-axis 'Number of Movies Released'.\n    *   For the stacked area chart (1, 0), label the x-axis 'Year' and the y-axis 'Proportion of Genres'.\n    *   Remove all nonsensical and unprofessional text ('Banana Count...', 'Genre Explosion Matrix', 'Nothing to see here', 'BOOM!').\n    *   The legend must contain labels for actual movie genre combinations.\n3.  **Clarity and Overlap:** Move the legend for the stacked area chart outside the plot area, for instance, to the right, to prevent any overlap with the data.\n4.  **Color Scheme:** Replace the jarring neon palette with a professional, perceptually uniform color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer or viridis). The colors should be distinct but harmonious.\n5.  **Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for a clean, publication-ready appearance.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and subtle.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the subplot titles and axis labels."
