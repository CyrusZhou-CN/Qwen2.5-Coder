    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and must be completely redone. A new chart should be created following these guidelines:\n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Use a single (1x1) line chart to plot the trends for all three genres (Animation, Children's, Comedy). This allows for direct comparison on the same set of axes.\n2. **Data Mapping:** The x-axis must represent 'Year' and the y-axis must represent the 'Count of Movies'. Each genre should be plotted as a separate line on the chart.\n3. **Text Content:**\n   - **Title:** Set a relevant title, such as 'Annual Movie Releases by Genre (1995-Present)'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Label the x-axis as 'Year' and the y-axis as 'Number of Movies Released'.\n   - **Legend:** Include a single, clear legend that maps each line color to its corresponding genre (e.g., 'Animation', 'Children's', 'Comedy').\n4. **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n   - **Background:** Use a standard white background for a professional appearance.\n   - **Colors:** Select a professional color palette with three distinct but harmonious colors for the lines. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors.\n   - **Gridlines:** If used, gridlines should be subtle (light gray and thin) to avoid distracting from the data.\n   - **Hierarchy:** Make the title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy."
