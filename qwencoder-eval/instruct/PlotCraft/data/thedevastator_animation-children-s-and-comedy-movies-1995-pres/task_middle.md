# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of movie genre combinations over time. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a line chart displaying the count of movies released each year from 1995 to present, and (2) a stacked area chart showing how the proportion of different genre combinations has changed over the years. Use different colors for each unique genre combination and ensure the legend clearly identifies each combination. Add appropriate titles, axis labels, and formatting to make the temporal trends easily interpretable.
