## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of CO2 emissions and environmental indicators across different countries from 1990-2020. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Line chart with confidence bands showing CO2 emissions per capita trends overlaid with scatter points for key milestone years, (2) Stacked area chart showing composition of different emission sources with trend lines for total emissions, (3) Dual-axis plot combining bar chart of annual emission changes with line plot of cumulative emissions.

Middle row: (4) Time series decomposition plot showing seasonal patterns in methane emissions with moving averages and trend components, (5) Slope chart connecting 1990 and 2020 values with intermediate milestone markers overlaid on a background heatmap of emission intensity, (6) Multi-line time series with error bands comparing agricultural vs energy sector emissions with filled areas showing the gap between them.

Bottom row: (7) Calendar heatmap of monthly emission data overlaid with box plots showing quarterly distributions, (8) Autocorrelation plot combined with partial autocorrelation analysis showing emission pattern dependencies over time, (9) Cross-correlation matrix heatmap between different emission types with time-lagged correlation coefficients displayed as a network graph overlay.

Each subplot must include country-specific trend analysis, statistical significance indicators, and highlight periods of major environmental policy changes or economic events that influenced emission patterns.
