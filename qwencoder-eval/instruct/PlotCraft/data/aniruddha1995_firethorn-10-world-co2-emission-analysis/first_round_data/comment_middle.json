Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout and Chart Type Correction**: \n    *   Create a 2x1 subplot layout (two rows, one column).\n    *   The top subplot (0, 0) must be a **line chart**.\n    *   The bottom subplot (1, 0) must be a **stacked area chart**.\n\n2.  **Data and Content Implementation**:\n    *   Use data for CO2 emissions from 1990-2020 for the top 3 emitting countries.\n    *   In the line chart (0, 0), the x-axis should be 'Year' and the y-axis should be 'Annual CO2 Emissions'. Plot three separate lines, one for each country.\n    *   In the stacked area chart (1, 0), the x-axis should be 'Year' and the y-axis should be 'Cumulative CO2 Emissions'. The areas for the three countries should be stacked on top of each other.\n\n3.  **Text and Labeling**: \n    *   Provide a clear main title for the entire figure, such as 'CO2 Emissions of Top 3 Countries (1990-2020)'.\n    *   Title the line chart (0, 0) 'Annual Emission Trends' and the stacked area chart (1, 0) 'Cumulative Contribution to Emissions'.\n    *   Ensure all axes are correctly labeled (e.g., 'Year', 'CO2 Emissions in Million Tonnes').\n    *   Use a single, clear legend for both plots to identify the countries. Place it outside the plot areas, for example, to the right of the charts.\n\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism**:\n    *   Adopt a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   Select a harmonious and distinguishable color palette for the three countries.\n    *   Ensure proper spacing between the two subplots to avoid a cluttered look.\n    *   Establish a clear text hierarchy: make the main title bold and larger than the subplot titles, which should be larger than the axis labels."
