    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus on both task compliance and visual refinement:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (1,0):** Replace the current line chart with a full time-series decomposition plot, showing separate panels for Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals as requested.\n    *   **Subplot (1,1):** Re-implement this as a proper slope chart connecting only the 1990 and 2020 data points. Add the required background heatmap to show emission intensity.\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** Change the data to compare 'agricultural vs. energy sector emissions'. Add a `fill_between` element to show the gap between the two lines.\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** Implement the requested 'calendar heatmap' for monthly data. The existing box plots for quarterly distributions can be placed alongside or below it.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** Add the 'network graph overlay' on top of the correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between emission types.\n    *   **Global Requirement:** Add annotations (e.g., `ax.axvline` with `ax.text`) to all relevant plots to highlight key policy or economic events, a core part of the prompt that was missed.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   **Overall:** Use `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6, wspace=0.4)` to increase the vertical and horizontal spacing between subplots, eliminating all overlaps.\n    *   **Main Title:** Reduce the font size of the main title ('Comprehensive Analysis...') and adjust its y-position to sit comfortably above the top row of subplots.\n\n3.  **Text and Labeling:**\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** Correct the y-axis label from 'Year' to something descriptive like 'Monthly Emission Value'. Change the x-axis tick labels from '1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5' to 'Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4' for clarity.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** To fix the overlapping x-axis labels, either increase the bottom margin of the plot or reduce the font size of the labels.\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** Add padding to the y-axis label ('CO2 Emissions (tons per capita)') to create more space between it and the y-tick labels."
