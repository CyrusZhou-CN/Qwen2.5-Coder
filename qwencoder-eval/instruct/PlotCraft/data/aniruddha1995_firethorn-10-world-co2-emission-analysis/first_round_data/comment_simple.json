    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. The primary issue is a misinterpretation of the prompt.\n1.  **Data Filtering:** The most critical change is to filter the dataset to include only four countries as specified in the prompt. Plotting the entire dataset is incorrect and renders the chart useless.\n2.  **Time Range Correction:** The x-axis must be adjusted to display the full requested time range from 1990 to 2020. The current plot starts after 2000.\n3.  **Legend Management:** Once the data is filtered to four countries, the legend will become manageable. It should be moved to a better position, such as the upper-right corner of the plot area or outside the plot to the right, to give the data more space.\n4.  **Layout and Aspect Ratio:** After fixing the legend, the overall aspect ratio of the chart should be adjusted to a more standard landscape format (e.g., 16:9 or 4:3). The current tall, narrow layout is a direct result of the oversized legend and should be corrected.\n5.  **Title Accuracy:** Ensure the title accurately reflects the content. After correcting the x-axis, the date range '(1990-2020)' in the title will be correct."
