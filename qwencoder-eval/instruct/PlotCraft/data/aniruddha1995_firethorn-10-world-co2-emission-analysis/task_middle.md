## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal evolution of CO2 emissions across different countries. Design a subplot layout with two complementary charts: (1) a line chart displaying CO2 emissions trends over time (1990-2020) for the top 3 countries by total emissions, and (2) a stacked area chart showing the cumulative contribution of these same countries to global CO2 emissions over the same time period. Both charts should highlight how emission patterns have changed over the three-decade span and reveal which countries have been the dominant contributors to global CO2 emissions.
