    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the pie chart with a histogram. The histogram is the correct chart type for visualizing the distribution of a single continuous variable.\n2. **Data Mapping:** The x-axis of the histogram should represent the 'Review Text Length (Character Count)', and the y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' (the count of reviews for each length bin).\n3. **Title and Labels:** Change the main title to something descriptive, such as 'Distribution of Review Text Lengths'. Label the x-axis 'Character Count' and the y-axis 'Frequency'.\n4. **Annotations:** The summary statistics (Mean, Median, Std) should be placed in a single, organized text box. A good position would be in the top-right corner of the plot area, away from the histogram bars. Use a single, neutral color (e.g., black or dark gray) for this text instead of the multiple bright colors.\n5. **Color and Formatting:** Use a professional and simple color scheme. A single color (e.g., steelblue or darkgray) for the histogram bars would be effective. Ensure all text is black for readability. The title should be bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy. Consider adding light gray, horizontal gridlines to make the frequency values easier to read."
