    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary and most critical improvement is to fix the generation process to populate all six subplots as requested in the prompt. The current output is fundamentally broken.\n\nAssuming the plots can be generated, here are specific suggestions:\n1.  **Populate All Subplots:** The code must be corrected to generate the visualizations for subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1). This includes the dual-axis plot, stacked area chart, heatmap/box plot combo, multi-line chart, and violin plots.\n2.  **Correct Axis Scales and Ticks:** For all subplots, ensure the axis ticks and limits are meaningful and reflect the data. For example, in subplot (0, 0), the x-axis should be formatted to show years (e.g., 2010, 2011, ...) instead of the current 0.0 to 1.0 scale.\n3.  **Refine Subplot (1, 1) - Restaurant Lifecycle Analysis:**\n    *   Clarify the x-axis label 'Quarter / Month'. If it represents months, a more descriptive label like 'Months Since Opening' would be better.\n    *   Add a legend to clearly distinguish the orange bars ('New Openings') from the purple line ('Average Rating').\n4.  **Handle Missing Data Gracefully:** For subplot (2, 1), if data is truly insufficient, instead of an empty plot with a small note, consider removing the axes and displaying a clear, centered message like 'Platform Comparison Not Available Due to Insufficient Data'.\n5.  **Enhance Readability and Professionalism:**\n    *   Add a main figure title (suptitle) to provide overall context, such as 'Comprehensive Analysis of Peruvian Restaurant Reviews'.\n    *   Ensure consistent font sizes for titles, axis labels, and tick labels across all six subplots for a cohesive and professional appearance.\n    *   Use a layout adjustment function (like `plt.tight_layout()` or `constrained_layout=True`) after plotting all data to ensure optimal spacing and prevent any potential overlap of titles or labels."
