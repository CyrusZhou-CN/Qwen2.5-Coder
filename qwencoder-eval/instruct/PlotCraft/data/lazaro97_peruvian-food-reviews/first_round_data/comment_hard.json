    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus on fulfilling the task requirements and fixing clarity issues:\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    -   **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the 'Polynomial Trend' line with the two requested lines: a '12-month rolling average' and a 'seasonal decomposition trend'. Update the legend accordingly.\n    -   **Subplot (1, 1):** Add the required 'correlation coefficient' as a text annotation in a clear area of the plot (e.g., top-left corner).\n    -   **Subplot (1, 2):** Include data and legend entries for the 'top 5 districts' as requested, not just four.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 0):** Expand the chart to show seasonal box and violin plots for all four quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) along the x-axis.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 1):** Overlay the 'multi-line time series' for each rating category on top of the existing stacked area chart.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 2):** Add annotations (e.g., points or vertical lines) to explicitly mark the 'crossover points' between the GooglePlaces and Tripadvisor rating lines.\n2.  **Text and Legend Clarity:**\n    -   **Subplot (1, 1):** Completely rebuild the legend. Separate the legend entries so they do not overlap. Move the correlation value out of the legend box and display it as a separate text annotation.\n    -   **Subplot (0, 1):** Add an x-axis label, e.g., 'Year'.\n    -   **General:** Make all subplot titles bold to improve the visual hierarchy.\n3.  **Color and Visual Enhancements:**\n    -   **Subplot (1, 1):** Increase the opacity or use a darker shade for the 'Review Volume' bars to make them clearly visible.\n4.  **Layout Refinements:**\n    -   **General:** Ensure consistent title phrasing across all subplots for a more cohesive look. For example, use a consistent format like 'Metric by Dimension' or 'Analysis of Metric'."
