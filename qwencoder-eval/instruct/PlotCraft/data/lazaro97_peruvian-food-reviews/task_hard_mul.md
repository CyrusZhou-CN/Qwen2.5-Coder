## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Peruvian restaurant reviews and ratings. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (1,1): Create a dual-axis time series plot showing monthly review volume (bar chart) overlaid with average monthly ratings (line chart with markers) from 2010-2021. Add a trend line for ratings evolution.

Top row (1,2): Design a stacked area chart showing the monthly distribution of review scores (1-5 stars) over time, with a secondary line plot overlay displaying the monthly percentage of 5-star reviews.

Middle row (2,1): Construct a seasonal decomposition visualization combining a heatmap showing average ratings by month and year, overlaid with box plots for each month showing rating distributions across all years.

Middle row (2,2): Build a restaurant lifecycle analysis showing new restaurant openings per quarter (bar chart) combined with a line chart tracking the average rating evolution of restaurants in their first 12 months of operation.

Bottom row (3,1): Create a district-based temporal analysis with multiple line charts showing rating trends over time for the top 5 districts by restaurant count, combined with ribbon/band plots showing confidence intervals.

Bottom row (3,2): Design a platform comparison visualization combining violin plots showing rating distributions by platform (GooglePlaces vs Tripadvisor) across different time periods, overlaid with trend lines showing platform-specific rating evolution over time.
