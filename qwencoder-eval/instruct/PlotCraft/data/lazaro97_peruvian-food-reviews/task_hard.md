## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Peruvian restaurant reviews from 2010-2021. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: (1,1) Monthly review volume over time with overlaid 12-month rolling average line and seasonal decomposition trend; (1,2) Average rating evolution by year with error bars showing standard deviation and overlaid polynomial trend line; (1,3) Cumulative restaurant count growth over time with quarterly growth rate overlay as bar chart.

Row 2: (2,1) Heatmap of review activity by month-year with overlaid contour lines showing peak activity periods; (2,2) Dual-axis plot showing monthly average rating (line) vs review volume (bars) with correlation coefficient annotation; (2,3) Time series of top 5 districts' review counts with filled area chart and individual trend lines.

Row 3: (3,1) Seasonal box plots of ratings by quarter with overlaid violin plots showing distribution density; (3,2) Multi-line time series of different rating categories (1-5 stars) as percentage of total reviews with stacked area overlay; (3,3) Interactive-style time series showing platform comparison (GooglePlaces vs Tripadvisor) with dual y-axes for review counts and average ratings, including crossover points annotation.
