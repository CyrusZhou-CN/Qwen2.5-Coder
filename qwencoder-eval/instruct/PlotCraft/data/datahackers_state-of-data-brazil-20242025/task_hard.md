## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the clustering patterns and hierarchical relationships within Brazil's data professional landscape. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Scatter plot with density contours showing the relationship between experience level and salary range, with points colored by geographic region and sized by company size, overlaid with cluster boundaries using K-means clustering; (2) Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of job roles based on their technology stack usage patterns, combined with a heatmap showing the correlation matrix of technology adoption across different roles; (3) Network graph displaying the connections between educational backgrounds and career paths, with nodes sized by frequency and edges weighted by transition probability, overlaid with community detection clusters.

Middle row: (4) Parallel coordinates plot showing the multi-dimensional profiles of data professionals across variables like age, experience, salary, and satisfaction levels, with lines colored by identified career clusters and overlaid with cluster centroids; (5) Treemap visualization of the hierarchical structure of the data job market (region > sector > company size > role), combined with a sunburst chart showing the same hierarchy with different color coding for remote work preferences; (6) Radar chart comparing the skill profiles of different professional clusters (identified through clustering analysis), overlaid with box plots showing the distribution of each skill within clusters.

Bottom row: (7) Geographic scatter plot of Brazil showing professional distribution by state, with points clustered using DBSCAN and colored by cluster membership, combined with a choropleth map overlay showing average salary by region; (8) Bipartite network graph showing the relationships between companies (by sector and size) and the technologies they use, with community detection to identify technology ecosystems, overlaid with a force-directed layout; (9) Time-series cluster analysis showing career progression patterns over experience years, with multiple line plots for different career trajectories identified through clustering, combined with a stacked area chart showing the evolution of role distributions over time.
