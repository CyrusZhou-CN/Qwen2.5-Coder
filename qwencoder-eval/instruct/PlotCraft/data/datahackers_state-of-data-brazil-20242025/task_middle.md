Correlation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis visualization that explores the relationships between professional satisfaction, salary expectations, and career progression factors in the Brazilian data market. Your visualization should consist of a 2x1 subplot layout where: (1) The top subplot displays a scatter plot with best-fit line showing the correlation between years of experience in data (2.i_tempo_de_experiencia_em_dados) and salary ranges (2.h_faixa_salarial), with points colored by current job satisfaction (2.k_satisfeito_atualmente) and sized by education level (1.l_nivel_de_ensino). (2) The bottom subplot presents a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between multiple career-related binary variables including job change intentions (2.n_planos_de_mudar_de_emprego_6m), remote work preferences (2.s_modelo_de_trabalho_ideal), and various job selection criteria (columns starting with "2.o."). Include proper data preprocessing to handle categorical variables and missing values, and add meaningful annotations to highlight the strongest correlations and their implications for career development in the data field.
