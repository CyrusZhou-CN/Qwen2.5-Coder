    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements and professional standards. \n1. **Overall Layout:** Use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust`) to eliminate the excessive white space between subplots. The plots should be significantly larger to fill the canvas, which will also help with text legibility.\n2. **Task Compliance:** Re-implement the subplots to match the prompt. Specifically: \n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** Add the required density contours and K-means cluster boundaries.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Add the hierarchical clustering dendrogram alongside the heatmap. The heatmap labels must be fixed.\n   - **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the current chart with the specified treemap and/or sunburst chart.\n   - **Subplot (1, 2):** Overlay the required box plots onto the radar chart to show skill distribution.\n   - **Subplot (2, 0):** Use actual geographic data for Brazil and overlay the required choropleth map showing average salary.\n3. **Text and Labeling:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** The feature labels on the heatmap are too long and dense. They must be drastically shortened, abbreviated, or a smaller, more relevant subset of features should be selected for visualization. As is, it is unusable.\n   - **Network Graphs (0, 2) & (2, 1):** Use a label-repelling algorithm or adjust the force-directed layout parameters to prevent node labels from overlapping.\n   - **Consistency:** Use a single language (preferably English, matching the titles) for all text elements, including axis labels, tick labels, and legends.\n   - **Clarity:** Change the axis labels on subplot (2, 0) from 'Latitude (synthetic)' and 'Longitude (synthetic)' to reflect actual geographic coordinates.\n4. **Aesthetics and Refinement:**\n   - **Color Palette:** Implement a unified color palette across all 9 subplots. For instance, if 'Cluster 1' is identified in plots (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 2), it should be represented by the same color in each.\n   - **Visual Hierarchy:** In the parallel coordinates plot (1, 0), increase the line width and opacity of the cluster centroid lines to make them stand out from the individual data point lines."
