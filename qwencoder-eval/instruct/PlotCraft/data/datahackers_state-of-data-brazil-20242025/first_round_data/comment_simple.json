It cannot be improved; it must be discarded and created from scratch. A new chart should be created following these guidelines:\n\n1.  **Start Over:** Create a single (1x1 layout) histogram.\n2.  **Correct Data and Chart Type:** Use a histogram to plot the frequency of data professionals across different age groups in Brazil, as requested.\n3.  **Axes:** The x-axis should represent the 'Age Group' bins, and the y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n4.  **Titles and Labels:**\n    *   Add a clear, descriptive main title like 'Age Distribution of Data Professionals in Brazil'. Make it bold and larger than other text for clear hierarchy.\n    *   Label the x-axis 'Age Group' and the y-axis 'Number of Professionals'.\n5.  **Formatting and Style:**\n    *   Use a clean, white background.\n    *   Use a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue or gray) for the histogram bars.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle, light gray, and horizontal only (on the y-axis) to avoid distracting from the data.\n    *   Ensure all text elements are legible and do not overlap."
