## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the economic transformation of BRICS nations from 1970 to 2020. Design a line chart that displays the GDP growth rates (annual %) for all five BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) over the 50-year period. Use different colors and line styles for each country, add a horizontal reference line at 0% growth to highlight periods of economic contraction, and include annotations for major economic events or crises that affected these nations. The visualization should reveal patterns of economic volatility, growth cycles, and how different BRICS economies responded to global economic shocks over the five decades.
