# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the economic transformation of BRICS nations from 1970 to 2020. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization types to reveal different aspects of economic change over time. The top-left subplot should display GDP growth rates as both line charts and bar charts overlaid, with different colors for each BRICS country. The top-right subplot should show the evolution of economic structure by plotting the percentage contribution of Agriculture, Industry, and Services to GDP as stacked area charts for each country, with small multiples arranged vertically. The bottom-left subplot should combine line charts showing GNI per capita trends with scatter plots indicating the relationship between GDP per capita and years, using different markers for each country. The bottom-right subplot should display trade openness (exports + imports as % of GDP) as line charts with confidence bands showing the volatility range, and overlay dot plots showing major economic milestone years. Each subplot must include trend lines, annotations for significant economic events, and consistent color coding across all visualizations.
