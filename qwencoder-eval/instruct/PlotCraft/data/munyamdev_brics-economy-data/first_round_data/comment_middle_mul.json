    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul due to fundamental data plotting errors. Here are the critical improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Critical Data Axis Correction:**\n    *   **Subplots (0, 0) and (0, 1):** The absolute priority is to fix the x-axis. It must be a time-based axis correctly scaled from 1970 to 2020. The current axes (0-2000 in (0,0) and 0.0-1.0 in (0,1)) are incorrect and render the plots meaningless.\n\n2.  **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** After fixing the x-axis, implement the missing bar chart overlay to show the average GDP growth by decade for each country.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Change the chart type from stacked bar charts to the requested stacked *area* charts to properly show the continuous evolution of sector composition over time.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Re-implement the trade balance visualization. Calculate the trade balance (exports - imports) as a new data series and plot it as a filled area chart on the secondary y-axis. This will clearly show trade surpluses (area above zero) and deficits (area below zero).\n    *   **Annotations:** Add the required annotations to highlight major economic events across all relevant subplots (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, China's WTO entry, etc.) to provide context.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Readability Enhancements:**\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** This plot is too cluttered. The best solution would be to replace it with small multiples, creating a separate, smaller plot for each country. This would allow for a clear view of each nation's export, import, and trade balance trends without overlap.\n    *   **Legends:** Simplify the legends in subplots (1, 0) and (1, 1). For (1,0), use one legend entry per country and explain the line styles (e.g., solid for exports, dashed for imports) in a subtitle. For (1,1), combine the two legends and use a more compact format (e.g., one entry per country, with line style indicating Investment vs. Savings).\n\n4.  **Text and Formatting Improvements:**\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Ensure all axis labels are descriptive and include units, e.g., 'GDP Growth Rate (%)', 'Share of GDP (%)'. The label 'Sector Composition' in (0,1) should be more specific.\n    *   **Titles:** While titles are present, they could be more descriptive. For example, 'GDP Growth Trends: Annual Rates and Decade Averages' is good. 'Economic Structure Evolution' could be more specific, like 'Evolution of GDP Composition by Sector (1970-2020)'."
