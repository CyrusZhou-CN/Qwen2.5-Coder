    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally an empty template and requires a complete implementation of the task prompt. Key improvements are:\n1.  **Populate with Data:** The most critical step is to plot the required data for all 5 BRICS nations from 1970-2020 in each of the six subplots.\n2.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** Each subplot must be created using the specific composite chart types requested in the prompt. For example:\n    *   Subplot (0, 0): Create a line chart for GDP per capita and overlay a bar chart for decadal averages.\n    *   Subplot (0, 1): Implement a stacked area chart for GDP composition and add trend lines.\n    *   Subplot (1, 1): Use a dual-axis plot with bars for FDI and a line for portfolio investment.\n3.  **Fix Title Overlap:** Adjust the layout to eliminate the overlap between the main figure title and the top-row subplot titles. This can be done by increasing the vertical space (`hspace` or using `fig.tight_layout(pad=...)`) or by moving the main title higher.\n4.  **Correct Axis Ticks and Labels:** The x-axis for all subplots must be reformatted to display the years from 1970 to 2020, not the current 0.0 to 1.0 scale.\n5.  **Correct Subplot Title:** Change the title of subplot (2, 0) from 'India: Sectoral Transformation & Manufacturing Growth' to a general title applicable to all BRICS nations, such as 'Economic Structure Transformation'.\n6.  **Add Legends and Annotations:** Add a clear legend to each subplot to identify the 5 countries. Add annotations for major economic events as requested to provide context to the data.\n7.  **Improve Layout and Proportions:** Adjust the overall figure size and aspect ratio to make the subplots less vertically stretched and more balanced."
