    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete recreation from scratch. \n1. **Layout and Chart Type:** Replace the 3x2 grid of bar charts with a single (1x1) line chart. All five countries' data should be plotted as distinct lines on this single chart to facilitate comparison.\n2. **Data and Labels:** \n   - The main title should be changed to 'Economic Transformation of BRICS Nations: GDP Growth (1970-2020)'.\n   - The x-axis must be labeled 'Year' and should range from 1970 to 2020.\n   - The y-axis must be labeled 'Annual GDP Growth (%)'.\n3. **Visual Encoding and Legend:**\n   - Assign a unique and professional color to each of the five BRICS countries. Avoid neon colors; use a standard qualitative color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer).\n   - In addition to color, use different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) for each country to ensure accessibility.\n   - Add a clear legend that maps each color/line style to the corresponding country name. Place it in the top-right or top-left corner, ensuring it does not overlap with the data lines.\n4. **Reference Lines and Annotations:**\n   - Implement the horizontal reference line at y=0. Make it a subtle gray dashed line to clearly separate periods of economic growth from contraction.\n   - Add specific, data-driven annotations for major economic events (e.g., '2008 Global Financial Crisis', '1997 Asian Financial Crisis') with arrows pointing to the corresponding data points on the chart.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a clean white background for the plot area.\n   - Use light gray, thin gridlines for the y-axis only to guide the eye without cluttering the view.\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy: make the main title bold and larger than the axis titles, which should be larger than the tick labels."
