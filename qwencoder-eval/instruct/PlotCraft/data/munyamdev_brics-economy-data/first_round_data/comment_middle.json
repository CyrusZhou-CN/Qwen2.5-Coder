  "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the prompt in any way. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality visualization:\\n\\n1.  **Adhere to the Prompt**: The primary issue is the complete disregard for the user's instructions. The new chart must be about the economic transformation of BRICS nations from 1970-2020.\\n2.  **Layout and Structure**: Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid. Ensure proper spacing (`plt.tight_layout()` or equivalent) to prevent titles and labels from overlapping.\\n3.  **Data and Chart Types (by subplot)**:\\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Plot GDP growth rates for the 5 BRICS countries. Use overlaid line charts and bar charts. Assign a unique color to each country and maintain this color consistency across all subplots.\\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1)**: Use small multiples (five vertically arranged sub-subplots) to show the changing economic structure (Agriculture, Industry, Services as % of GDP) for each country using stacked area charts.\\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0)**: Combine line charts (for GNI per capita) and scatter plots (GDP per capita vs. years). Use the consistent country colors for the lines and distinct markers for the scatter plot points.\\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: Show trade openness using line charts with shaded confidence bands. Overlay dot plots or vertical lines to mark and annotate significant economic events (e.g., 'India's economic liberalization 1991').\\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism**:\\n    *   **Background and Grid**: Use a white background for the figure and all subplots. If gridlines are necessary, make them light gray and subtle.\\n    *   **Colors**: Select a professional color palette with good contrast and harmony. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors. A palette from ColorBrewer2 or seaborn's 'colorblind' palette would be a good choice.\\n    *   **Text and Hierarchy**: Use a clean, legible font. Create a clear visual hierarchy: make the main figure title the largest and boldest, followed by subplot titles, and then axis labels. Ensure all labels are descriptive and accurate (e.g., 'GDP Growth Rate (%)', 'Year').\\n5.  **Clarity and Readability**: Ensure lines are not too thick and that markers are appropriately sized. Place legends where they do not obscure data."
