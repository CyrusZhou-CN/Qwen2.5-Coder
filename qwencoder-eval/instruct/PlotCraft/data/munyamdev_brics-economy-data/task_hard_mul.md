## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the economic evolution of BRICS nations from 1970-2020. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (GDP Analysis):
- Subplot 1: GDP per capita growth trends (line chart) with overlaid bar chart showing average growth by decade for each country
- Subplot 2: GDP composition evolution showing stacked area chart of agriculture, industry, and services value-added percentages with trend lines for each sector

Middle row (Trade & Investment):
- Subplot 3: Trade balance analysis combining line charts for exports and imports as % of GDP with filled area between them showing trade surplus/deficit
- Subplot 4: Foreign investment flows showing dual-axis plot with FDI inflows (bars) and portfolio investment (line) over time

Bottom row (Development Indicators):
- Subplot 5: Economic structure transformation using stacked bar charts for sectoral employment/value-added with overlaid line showing manufacturing as % of GDP
- Subplot 6: Financial development indicators combining multiple line charts for gross savings rate, capital formation rate, and external debt as % of GNI with different line styles and colors

Each subplot must show all 5 BRICS countries with distinct colors/patterns, include proper legends, and demonstrate how these economies have transformed over the 50-year period. Use appropriate scaling, annotations for major economic events, and ensure visual coherence across all subplots.
