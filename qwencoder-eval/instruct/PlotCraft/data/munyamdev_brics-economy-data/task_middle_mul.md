## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the economic transformation of BRICS nations from 1970 to 2020. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple chart types:

1. Top-left: GDP Growth Trends - Create a line chart showing annual GDP growth rates for all 5 BRICS countries over time, overlaid with a bar chart showing the average GDP growth by decade for each country.

2. Top-right: Economic Structure Evolution - Display stacked area charts showing the changing composition of GDP by sector (Agriculture, Industry, Services) for each BRICS country, with each country's chart positioned as small multiples within this subplot.

3. Bottom-left: Trade Balance Dynamics - Combine line charts showing exports and imports as percentage of GDP over time for all countries, with a secondary y-axis showing the trade balance (exports minus imports) as filled area charts.

4. Bottom-right: Investment and Savings Patterns - Create dual-axis charts showing gross capital formation and gross domestic savings as percentages of GDP over time, with scatter plot overlays indicating the relationship between savings and investment rates for each country in different decades.

Use distinct colors for each BRICS country throughout all subplots, add trend lines where appropriate, and include annotations highlighting major economic milestones or policy changes. Ensure all subplots have proper legends, axis labels, and titles that clearly communicate the economic transformation story of these emerging economies.
