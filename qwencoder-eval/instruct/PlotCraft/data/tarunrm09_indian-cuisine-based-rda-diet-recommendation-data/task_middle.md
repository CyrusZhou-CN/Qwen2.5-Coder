Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the nutritional composition of Indian dishes across different meal types. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot is a stacked bar chart displaying the average macronutrient composition (Calories, Fats, Proteins, Carbohydrates) for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner dishes, and the bottom plot is a pie chart showing the distribution of vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes across all meal types. Use different color schemes for each subplot and ensure proper labeling and legends.
