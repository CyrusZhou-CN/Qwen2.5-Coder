# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the nutritional composition of Indian dishes across different meal types and dietary preferences. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): For each meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner), create stacked bar charts showing the average nutritional composition (Calories, Proteins, Fats, Carbohydrates) with overlaid line plots indicating the fiber content trend across dishes within that meal category.

Middle row (3 subplots): Create treemap visualizations for vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes, showing the hierarchical breakdown of macro-nutrients (Proteins, Fats, Carbohydrates) as nested rectangles, with each treemap also including pie chart insets displaying the micro-nutrient distribution (Iron, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium) for that dietary category.

Bottom row (3 subplots): Generate waffle charts representing the sugar content distribution across different calorie ranges (low: <100, medium: 100-200, high: >200 calories), with each waffle chart overlaid with violin plots showing the vitamin D and fiber density distributions for dishes in that calorie range.
