# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Afghanistan over time. Design a subplot with two y-axes: the left y-axis should display daily new cases as a line chart, while the right y-axis should show the 7-day smoothed new deaths as a bar chart. Additionally, overlay the stringency index as a semi-transparent area chart to show how government response measures correlate with case trends. Use different colors for each metric and include a legend. Format the x-axis to show dates clearly and add appropriate titles and axis labels.
