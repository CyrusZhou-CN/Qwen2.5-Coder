    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this dashboard, the following specific changes are required:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections**:\n    - **Subplot (0, 0)**: Swap the chart types. `new_cases` should be a line chart and `new_deaths` should be a bar chart.\n    - **Subplot (1, 0)**: The plots must be overlaid, not side-by-side. The box plot should be drawn inside the violin plot, and the strip plot points should be scattered on top of both.\n    - **Subplot (1, 1)**: Re-implement as a pair-plot style matrix. The upper triangle must contain scatter plots for each variable pair.\n    - **Subplot (2, 0)**: This subplot needs a complete rewrite. It must be implemented as a proper calendar heatmap (e.g., using a library like `calmap`), where days are colored by case counts, and the 7-day average is overlaid as a line.\n    - **Subplot (2, 1)**: Add the required Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plot. A good approach would be to create two vertically stacked axes within the (2, 1) grid cell, one for the ACF and one for the PACF.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing Adjustments**:\n    - **Global Layout**: Apply a layout adjustment function (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)`) to increase the spacing between all subplots and prevent titles and labels from colliding.\n    - **Main Title**: Significantly reduce the font size of the main dashboard title to prevent it from overlapping with the subplot titles in the first row. A font size of 16pt would be more appropriate.\n\n3.  **Text and Data Formatting**:\n    - **Subplot (0, 2)**: Critically, fix the data processing for the x-axis to display the correct date range (2020-2024) instead of the erroneous 1970-2020 range.\n    - **Subplot (2, 0)**: After reimplementing as a calendar heatmap, ensure the axes are correctly labeled (e.g., 'Month' or 'Week' on the y-axis, 'Day of Week' on the x-axis).\n    - **Subplot (1, 1)**: Improve readability of the x-axis labels by either increasing the figure width or using a smaller font size.\n\n4.  **Professional Formatting**:\n    - **Spines/Borders**: Soften the appearance by making the chart borders (spines) a lighter gray color instead of solid black.\n    - **Hierarchy**: Ensure a clear visual hierarchy. The main title should be largest, followed by subplot titles, and then axis labels. All axis labels should have a consistent font size across the grid."
