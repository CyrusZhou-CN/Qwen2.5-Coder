    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Change Chart Type:** The most critical improvement is to change the visualization to a proper line chart as requested. This will connect the data points and effectively show the trend over time, which is the primary goal of the task. This will also eliminate the severe visual clutter caused by the current stem plot.\n2. **Filter Data Range:** The prompt specifically asks to show the 'early months of the pandemic'. The data should be filtered to a more appropriate range, such as from January 2020 to December 2020, to meet this requirement. This will provide a more focused and detailed view of the initial outbreak.\n3. **Improve X-Axis Formatting:** For the filtered 'early months' view, the x-axis tick labels should be more granular. Instead of just showing the year, format them to show month abbreviations (e.g., 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May' or 'Mar 2020', 'Apr 2020', etc.) to provide better temporal context.\n4. **Enhance Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title bold to give it more prominence and establish a clearer visual hierarchy between the title and the axis labels.\n5. **Refine Data Elements:** Remove the large circular markers or make them much smaller. For a dense time-series dataset, a simple line without markers is often sufficient and cleaner.\n6. **Adjust Color:** Consider using a slightly less saturated shade of blue for the line to create a more professional and less harsh appearance."
