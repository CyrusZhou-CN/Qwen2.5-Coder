    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete regeneration. \n1. **Correct the Data and Content:** The primary issue is the use of incorrect data. The chart must be recreated using the actual COVID-19 data for Afghanistan. All text elements—the main title, axis labels, and legend—must be replaced with accurate and relevant descriptions (e.g., Title: 'COVID-19 Trends in Afghanistan', Left Y-axis: 'Daily New Cases', Right Y-axis: '7-Day Smoothed New Deaths').\n2. **Fix the Layout:** Remove the extraneous pie chart at the top. The final output should be a single subplot (1x1 layout) as requested.\n3. **Implement Correct Chart Types:** Adhere strictly to the prompt's requirements: use a line chart for daily cases, a bar chart for smoothed deaths, and a semi-transparent area chart for the stringency index.\n4. **Improve Color Scheme:** Replace the current neon palette with a professional and harmonious color scheme. For example, use a standard blue for the case line, a muted orange for the death bars, and a light, semi-transparent gray (e.g., `color='grey', alpha=0.3`) for the stringency index area chart. This will improve clarity and visual appeal.\n5. **Enhance Text and Formatting:** \n   - Use a white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines for a clean, professional appearance.\n   - Ensure all text is black or dark gray for maximum readability. The yellow x-axis tick labels are illegible and must be changed.\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n   - Correct the legend to be readable (no overlapping text) and place it in a non-obstructive position, such as the upper-left corner."
