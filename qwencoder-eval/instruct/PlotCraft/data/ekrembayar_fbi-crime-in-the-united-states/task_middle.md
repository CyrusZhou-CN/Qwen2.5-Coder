# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the temporal evolution of crime patterns across US regions from 2015 to 2016. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a line chart displaying the year-over-year percentage change in total violent crime rates for each of the four major US regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and (2) an area chart showing the absolute change in property crime numbers between 2015 and 2016 for the same regions, with each region represented as a stacked area to visualize both the magnitude and direction of change. Use different colors for each region and include proper legends, titles, and annotations highlighting which regions experienced the most significant increases or decreases in crime rates.
