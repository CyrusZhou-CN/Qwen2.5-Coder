    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the user's prompt. A complete redesign is necessary.\n\n1.  **Start Over:** Discard the current design entirely. The layout, chart types, and data are all wrong.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a 2x1 layout with two subplots. \n    *   **Subplot (0, 0) (Top):** This should be a line chart as requested. The x-axis should represent the years (2015, 2016). The y-axis should be labeled 'Year-over-Year % Change in Violent Crime'. Plot four distinct lines, one for each US region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West).\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0) (Bottom):** This should be a stacked area chart. Since the data is a single change value (2015 to 2016), a stacked bar chart might be more appropriate. If using an area chart, the x-axis could be a single category labeled '2015-2016 Change'. The y-axis should be labeled 'Absolute Change in Property Crime'. The areas/bars for each of the four regions should be stacked.\n3.  **Color and Aesthetics:**\n    *   Use a professional and harmonious color palette to represent the four regions. Avoid the harsh primary colors used in the generated chart. A sequential or qualitative palette from a library like ColorBrewer would be suitable.\n    *   Switch to a standard white background for a clean, professional look.\n    *   Remove the thick, colored borders around the plots. Use standard, thin, black or gray spines.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray, thin dashed lines).\n4.  **Text and Annotations:**\n    *   Provide a clear, overarching title for the entire figure, such as 'US Crime Pattern Changes by Region (2015-2016)'.\n    *   Give each subplot a specific title (e.g., 'Violent Crime Rate Change' and 'Property Crime Number Change').\n    *   Ensure all axes are clearly and accurately labeled.\n    *   Create a single, clear legend for the entire figure that maps the chosen colors to the four US regions.\n    *   Add meaningful annotations based on the actual data, for example, using an arrow to point to the line with the steepest increase and adding text like 'Largest increase in the West'."
