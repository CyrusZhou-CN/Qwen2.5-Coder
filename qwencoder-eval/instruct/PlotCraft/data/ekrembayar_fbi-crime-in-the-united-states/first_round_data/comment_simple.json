No part of the current visualization is salvageable.\n\n1.  **Chart Type and Data:** Discard the pie and scatter plots. Create a single horizontal bar chart. The y-axis should list the names of the top 15 states, and the x-axis should represent the 'Violent Crime Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants'.\n2.  **Sorting:** Arrange the bars in descending order, with the state having the highest crime rate positioned at the top of the chart.\n3.  **Title and Labels:** The main title should be clear and descriptive, such as 'Top 15 States by Violent Crime Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 2016'. The x-axis should be clearly labeled with its units.\n4.  **Color Scheme and Legend:** Implement the requested color-coding. Use two distinct, professional colors (e.g., a muted red for 'Above National Average' and a muted blue for 'Below National Average'). Add a clear legend to explain this color scheme.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:** Use a standard white background for clarity. Choose a clean, legible font (e.g., sans-serif). Ensure gridlines are subtle (light gray) and do not distract from the data bars. The overall design should be clean, professional, and focused on presenting the data clearly."
