# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing FBI crime trends across different dimensions. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Regional Analysis
- Subplot 1: Combine a grouped bar chart showing 2015 vs 2016 violent crime rates by region with overlaid line plots showing the percent change trends
- Subplot 2: Create a stacked area chart showing property crime composition (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft) over time by region, with error bars indicating rate variability
- Subplot 3: Display a dual-axis plot with violin plots showing violent crime rate distributions by region and overlaid scatter points showing individual state positions

Row 2: State-Level Temporal Patterns
- Subplot 4: Generate a slope chart connecting 2015 to 2016 crime rates for top 10 highest crime states, combined with a background heatmap showing rate intensity
- Subplot 5: Create a time series decomposition-style plot showing both violent and property crime trends with confidence intervals and seasonal adjustment indicators
- Subplot 6: Combine a diverging bar chart showing percent changes in crime rates by state with marginal histograms showing the distribution of changes

Row 3: Crime Type Evolution
- Subplot 7: Display a parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between different crime types (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault) with density curves at each axis
- Subplot 8: Create a bubble chart where bubble size represents total crime volume, x-axis shows violent crime rate, y-axis shows property crime rate, with color-coded regions and trend lines
- Subplot 9: Generate a correlation matrix heatmap of all crime types overlaid with network-style connections showing strongest correlations and scatter plots in the lower triangle

Each subplot must include appropriate statistical annotations, trend indicators, and comparative elements that reveal insights about crime pattern evolution from 2015 to 2016.
