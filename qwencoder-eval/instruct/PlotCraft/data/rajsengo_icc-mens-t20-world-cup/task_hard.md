## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing team performance clusters and bowling attack patterns in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 - Team Performance Clusters:
- Subplot 1: Scatter plot with team total scores (x-axis) vs boundaries hit (y-axis), overlaid with bubble sizes representing wickets lost, plus marginal histograms showing score and boundary distributions
- Subplot 2: Radar chart comparing batting metrics (average runs, strike rate, boundary percentage) for top 6 teams, overlaid with a line plot showing their tournament progression
- Subplot 3: Hierarchical cluster dendrogram of teams based on batting statistics, combined with a heatmap showing correlation matrix of key batting metrics

Row 2 - Bowling Attack Analysis:
- Subplot 4: Violin plot showing economy rate distributions by bowling team, overlaid with strip plots of individual bowler performances and box plots highlighting quartiles
- Subplot 5: Network graph showing bowler-batsman dismissal relationships (nodes sized by wickets/runs), combined with a circular bar chart of wicket types around the perimeter
- Subplot 6: Parallel coordinates plot for bowler performance metrics (overs, economy, wickets, dots), overlaid with a slope chart showing before/after tournament rankings

Row 3 - Match Dynamics:
- Subplot 7: Stacked area chart showing run accumulation patterns over overs for different match outcomes, combined with error bands representing scoring variance
- Subplot 8: Treemap of venue performance hierarchies (countries > cities > venues) sized by total runs scored, overlaid with a sunburst chart showing toss decision outcomes
- Subplot 9: Time series plot of team momentum throughout the tournament (match-by-match performance), combined with a correlation heatmap of performance metrics and a trend decomposition overlay

Use consistent color schemes to represent teams across all subplots and ensure each composite visualization reveals distinct clustering patterns or hierarchical relationships in the cricket data.
