    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet the task requirements for composite charts. To fix this, every subplot needs to be recreated according to the prompt.\n\n**Task Compliance Fixes:**\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Add marginal histograms along the x and y axes to show the distributions of 'Average Total Score' and 'Average Boundaries'.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Overlay a line plot on the radar chart to show the tournament progression for each of the top 6 teams.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 2):** Add a hierarchical cluster dendrogram next to the heatmap to show how teams are grouped based on the batting metrics.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Overlay strip plots and box plots onto the violin plots to show individual data points and quartile distributions.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1):** The main visualization should be a network graph of bowler-batsman dismissals; the circular bar chart of wicket types should be a secondary, combined element.\n6.  **Subplot (2, 1):** Replace the current stacked bar chart with a proper treemap to accurately represent the venue hierarchy and runs scored.\n7.  **Subplot (2, 2):** Add the requested correlation heatmap of performance metrics alongside the time series plot.\n\n**Visual Quality Improvements:**\n1.  **Element Positioning:** In subplot (0, 0), use a text repulsion algorithm to prevent the team name labels from overlapping. This is the most critical visual fix needed.\n2.  **Color Scheme:** Implement a consistent color map for teams. For instance, assign 'India' a specific color (e.g., blue) and use that same blue in every subplot where India's data appears, such as (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).\n3.  **Legend Optimization:** In subplot (0, 1), correct the legend to remove the duplicate entry for 'NAM'.\n4.  **Text Formatting:** In subplot (1, 1), slightly increase the font size of the labels ('caught', 'bowled', etc.) on the circular bar chart for better readability."
