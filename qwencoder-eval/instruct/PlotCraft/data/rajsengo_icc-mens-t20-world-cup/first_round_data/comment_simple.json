    "improvement_suggestions": "The current chart is unsalvageable and needs to be completely regenerated from scratch. \n1. **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a single plot containing only the horizontal bar chart. The pie chart must be removed entirely.\n2. **Text Content:**\n   - **Title:** Provide a single, accurate title, such as 'Top 10 Bowlers by Economy Rate'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Set the y-axis label to 'Bowler' and the x-axis label to 'Economy Rate (Runs per Over)'.\n3. **Data Presentation:**\n   - **Y-Axis Ticks:** Ensure the bowler names on the y-axis are clearly legible. Increase the figure's height to provide adequate spacing between the bars and prevent any overlap of the names.\n   - **Sorting:** The bars should be sorted in ascending order based on the economy rate, with the bowler having the lowest rate at the top of the chart.\n4. **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n   - **Background and Grid:** Use a clean white background. Employ subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines to help guide the eye, and remove the default chart border (spines) for a cleaner look.\n   - **Color:** Replace the harsh green with a more professional, single color (e.g., a muted blue or steel gray) for all bars to maintain consistency.\n   - **Typography:** Use a clear typographic hierarchy. The main title should be bold and larger than the axis labels to establish it as the primary piece of information."
