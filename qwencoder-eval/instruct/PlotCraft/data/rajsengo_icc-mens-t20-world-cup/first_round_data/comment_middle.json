    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Y-Axis Range**: In subplot (0, 0), the y-axis range must be corrected. Set the lower limit to 0, as 'Wickets Taken' cannot be negative. For example: `plt.ylim(0, 5.5)`.\n2. **Enhance Color Palette**: For subplot (1, 0), replace the current color map with one designed for a high number of categorical variables to ensure each team is distinguishable. Consider using a palette like 'tab20' or a custom list of distinct colors.\n3. **Improve Legend Layout**: In subplot (1, 0), reformat the 'Teams' legend to be more compact. Arranging it into two or three columns would reduce the overall width of the figure and create a more balanced layout.\n4. **Strengthen Visual Hierarchy**: Make the titles of both subplots bold to clearly separate them from other text elements and establish a stronger visual hierarchy.\n5. **Resolve Text Inconsistency**: In subplot (0, 0), ensure the correlation value is consistent. Use the same rounded value (e.g., 'r = -0.38') in both the annotation box and the legend.\n6. **Adjust Annotation Position**: In subplot (0, 0), move the annotation box to the top-right corner of the plot area to avoid any overlap with the data points."
