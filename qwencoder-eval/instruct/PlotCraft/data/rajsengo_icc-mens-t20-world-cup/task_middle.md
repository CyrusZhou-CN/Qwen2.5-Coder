## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between bowling performance and match outcomes in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a scatter plot with best fit line examining the correlation between bowling economy rate and wickets taken, with points colored by whether the bowling team won or lost the match. The bottom plot should display a bubble chart showing the relationship between runs conceded and wickets taken, where bubble sizes represent the number of overs bowled and colors indicate different teams. Include appropriate legends, titles, and annotations to highlight key insights about how bowling statistics correlate with team success.
