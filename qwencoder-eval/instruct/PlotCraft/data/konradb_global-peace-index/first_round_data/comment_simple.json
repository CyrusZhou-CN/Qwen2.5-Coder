    "improvement_suggestions": "To align with the prompt and improve quality, the following changes are necessary:\n1. **Simplify Layout:** Remove the pie chart (subplot (0, 0)) and the scatter plot (subplot (1, 0)) entirely. The final output should consist of only one chart: the horizontal bar chart.\n2. **Correct Content and Labels:**\n   - **Title:** Provide a single, accurate title for the chart, such as 'Top 15 Most Peaceful Countries (2023 Global Peace Index)'.\n   - **Data:** Replace the generic 'Country_0', 'Country_1', etc., with the actual names of the top 15 most peaceful countries.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Correct the axis labels. The vertical (y-axis) should represent the countries, and the horizontal (x-axis) should be labeled 'Global Peace Index Score'.\n   - **Annotation:** Remove the nonsensical text annotation 'Zlorp'.\n3. **Implement Meaningful Coloring:** Replace the single yellow color for the bars. Use a sequential color palette (e.g., shades of green or blue) where the color intensity corresponds to the peace index score, effectively distinguishing between different levels as requested.\n4. **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n   - **Background and Grid:** Change the background to white and use subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines to guide the eye. Remove the vertical gridlines.\n   - **Typography:** Make the main title bold and larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n   - **Ranking Order:** Ensure the countries are sorted from top to bottom, starting with the most peaceful (lowest score) at the top."
