    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete recreation from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1. **Layout and Chart Type:** Use a single 1x1 subplot. On this subplot, plot the country data as line charts and the global average as a semi-transparent area chart using a function like `fill_between`.\n2. **Data and Axes:** The x-axis must be 'Year' (ranging from 2008 to 2023) and the y-axis must be 'Peace Index Score'. Ensure the correct data for the top 5, bottom 5, and global average peace indices are plotted.\n3. **Text and Labels:**\n   - Change the main title to something appropriate, like 'Evolution of Global Peace Index Scores (2008-2023)'.\n   - Label the x-axis 'Year' and the y-axis 'Peace Index Score'.\n   - Implement a clear legend to distinguish between 'Top 5 Most Peaceful Countries', 'Bottom 5 Least Peaceful Countries', and 'Global Average'.\n4. **Color and Styling:**\n   - Replace the current color scheme with a professional palette. For example, use a muted blue for the most peaceful countries, a muted red/orange for the least peaceful, and a light, neutral gray for the global average area chart.\n   - Apply different line styles as requested (e.g., solid lines for the top 5, dashed lines for the bottom 5).\n   - Set the transparency (alpha) of the area chart to a low value (e.g., 0.3) to ensure the line charts are clearly visible.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a white background for the chart.\n   - Make gridlines subtle (light gray and thin) to serve as a guide without distracting from the data.\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the axis labels."
