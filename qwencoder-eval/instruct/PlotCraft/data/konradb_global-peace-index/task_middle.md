## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of peace index scores over time. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a line chart displaying the peace index trends from 2008 to 2023 for the top 5 most peaceful countries and bottom 5 least peaceful countries in 2023, with different colors and line styles to distinguish between the two groups, and (2) an area chart overlay showing the overall global peace index trend (average of all countries) as a semi-transparent filled area to provide context for how individual country trends compare to the global pattern.
