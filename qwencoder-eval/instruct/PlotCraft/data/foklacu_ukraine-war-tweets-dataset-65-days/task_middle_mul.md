## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Ukraine war discourse on Twitter. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization types:

Top-left: Create a stacked area chart showing the daily tweet volume trends across all 8 search terms over time, overlaid with a line plot showing the cumulative engagement (sum of likes, retweets, replies) to reveal how both volume and audience response evolved during the conflict.

Top-right: Design a dual-axis time series where the primary axis shows the daily average sentiment score (derived from like-to-reply ratios) as a line chart, while the secondary axis displays the proportion of tweets containing media attachments as a bar chart, demonstrating how content richness changed over time.

Bottom-left: Construct a multi-line time series showing the daily count of unique hashtags used across all datasets, with each line representing a different search term category, supplemented by a background heatmap showing the intensity of cross-dataset hashtag overlap by day.

Bottom-right: Build a combination chart with a line plot tracking the daily percentage of tweets that are replies (indicating conversation levels) and a scatter plot overlay showing the relationship between daily tweet volume and average user follower counts, revealing how discourse patterns and user influence evolved throughout the crisis.
