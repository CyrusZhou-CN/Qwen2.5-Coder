## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis visualization showing how tweet engagement patterns evolved across different Ukraine war-related search terms over the 65-day period. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization types: (1) Top-left: Line chart showing daily tweet volume trends overlaid with a bar chart showing average engagement scores (likes + retweets + replies) for each search term, (2) Top-right: Stacked area chart displaying the cumulative distribution of tweet sources (Twitter for iPhone, Android, Web App, etc.) over time with a secondary line plot showing the proportion of verified users, (3) Bottom-left: Multi-line time series showing the evolution of sentiment indicators (reply count vs like count ratios) combined with scatter points sized by quote count for different search terms, (4) Bottom-right: Heatmap calendar view showing tweet intensity by day overlaid with line plots tracking the emergence of key hashtags (#StandWithUkraine, #NoWar, etc.) across the timeline. Each subplot should use different color schemes to distinguish between the 8 search terms and include trend lines to highlight temporal patterns in social media discourse evolution.
