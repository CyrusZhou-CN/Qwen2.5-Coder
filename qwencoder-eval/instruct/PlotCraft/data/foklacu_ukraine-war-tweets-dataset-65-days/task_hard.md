## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of Ukraine war discourse on Twitter. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 - Tweet Volume Analysis:
- Subplot 1: Line chart showing daily tweet counts for each search term overlaid with a bar chart showing total engagement (likes + retweets + replies) per day
- Subplot 2: Stacked area chart displaying the cumulative distribution of tweet sources (Twitter for iPhone, Android, Web App, etc.) over time with a line overlay showing verified vs non-verified user ratios
- Subplot 3: Dual-axis plot combining a line chart of average sentiment indicators (like count as proxy) with a histogram showing the distribution of tweet languages per day

Row 2 - Engagement Evolution:
- Subplot 4: Multi-line chart tracking engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies, quotes) over time with filled areas between lines to show engagement intensity bands
- Subplot 5: Scatter plot with trend lines showing the relationship between follower count and engagement over time, with point sizes representing tweet frequency and colors representing search terms
- Subplot 6: Box plots showing daily engagement distributions overlaid with violin plots to reveal engagement pattern changes throughout the conflict period

Row 3 - Content and Network Dynamics:
- Subplot 7: Heatmap showing hashtag co-occurrence patterns over time combined with line plots tracking the emergence and decline of specific hashtag clusters
- Subplot 8: Network-style visualization showing user mention patterns overlaid with time-series lines tracking the evolution of key influencer engagement
- Subplot 9: Composite chart combining a time-series of media attachment rates (photos, videos) with bar charts showing the distribution of tweet types (original, replies, quotes) across the dataset timeline

Each subplot must reveal how different aspects of the Ukraine war Twitter discourse evolved during the 65-day period, emphasizing temporal patterns, shifts in engagement behavior, and the changing nature of the conversation.
