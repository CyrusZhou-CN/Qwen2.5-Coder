    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Fundamental Errors in Subplot (1,1):**\n   - **Line Plot:** The 'Reply Percentage' should be a line chart plotted against the correct date range on the x-axis, not a single vertical line.\n   - **Scatter Plot:** This plot is entirely incorrect. It should show the relationship between 'daily tweet volume' (on the x-axis) and 'average user follower counts' (on the y-axis). The current x-axis showing dates from 1970-2020 must be replaced. The legend entry 'Volume vs Followers' should be removed as the axes themselves should be labeled to show this relationship.\n\n2. **Complete Missing Requirements in Subplot (1,0):**\n   - Add the specified background heatmap to visualize the intensity of cross-dataset hashtag overlap by day. This was a key requirement that was omitted.\n   - Change the x-axis label from 'Days Since Start' to 'Date' to maintain consistency with the top-row plots.\n\n3. **Enhance Clarity and Consistency:**\n   - **Subplot (0,1):** Identify the unlabeled brown line. Either add a corresponding entry to the legend or remove the line if it is an error.\n   - **Color Palette:** Adopt a single, harmonious color palette across all four subplots to create a cohesive and professional visual identity. Replace the jarring bright green and purple in subplot (1,1) with colors from this unified palette.\n   - **Typographic Hierarchy:** Make all subplot titles bold to distinguish them more clearly from axis labels and improve the overall structure.\n\n4. **Refine Formatting:**\n   - **Axis Labels:** Ensure all axes are clearly and correctly labeled. For the corrected subplot (1,1), the axes should be 'Daily Tweet Volume' and 'Avg User Followers' for the scatter plot.\n   - **Legends:** Review all legends for clarity and accuracy. The legend in subplot (1,1) is particularly confusing and needs to be corrected along with the plot itself."
