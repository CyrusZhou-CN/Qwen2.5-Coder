    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to plot the actual data. The chart is currently an empty template. Specifically:\n1.  **Plot Data Lines:** Add the line plots representing the hourly tweet volume for each of the different search terms as requested.\n2.  **Correct Y-Axis Scale:** The y-axis range must be adjusted from the current 0-1 scale to reflect the actual 'Number of Tweets'. The axis should automatically scale to fit the maximum tweet count in the data.\n3.  **Populate Legend:** The legend in the top-right corner is empty. It must be populated to clearly identify which color and line style corresponds to which search term.\n4.  **Implement Line Styles:** The prompt requested different line styles in addition to different colors. This should be implemented to enhance distinguishability between the lines, which is also beneficial for accessibility (e.g., for colorblind viewers or black-and-white printing).\n5.  **Review Caption:** The faint gray caption at the bottom is a good addition for context, but its font size could be slightly increased or its color darkened to improve readability."
