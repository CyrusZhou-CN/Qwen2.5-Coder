    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Fix Title Overlap and Hierarchy**: Reduce the font size of the main title ('Temporal Evolution...') and place it clearly above the entire grid using `fig.suptitle()`. Ensure all subplot titles are distinct, correctly placed, and have a smaller font size than the main title to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n2. **Implement Correct Chart Types**: \n   - For the top row (subplots (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)), replace the single area chart for 'Likes' with the required **stacked area chart** showing 'Likes', 'Retweets', and 'Replies' on the secondary y-axis.\n   - For the bottom row (subplots (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)), add the required **scatter plots** overlaid on the existing line plots. The scatter points should represent high-engagement tweets, and their size should be proportional to the total engagement value.\n3. **Refine Layout and Spacing**: Use `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9, hspace=0.4)` to fix the title overlap and adjust the vertical spacing (hspace) between the top and bottom rows for a more balanced look.\n4. **Improve Text Formatting**: \n   - Make axis labels regular weight instead of bold to reduce visual clutter and improve the distinction from titles.\n   - For the bottom row, consider using a single, centered x-axis label ('Date') to avoid redundancy.\n5. **Clarify Subplot Content**: The title for subplot (0,1) is unclear; it should be explicitly set (e.g., 'Military Forces Discourse'). The legends for subplots (1,1) and (1,2) should be reviewed to ensure they accurately reflect the datasets being plotted as per the prompt's instructions ('All datasets combined' and 'Comparative analysis')."
