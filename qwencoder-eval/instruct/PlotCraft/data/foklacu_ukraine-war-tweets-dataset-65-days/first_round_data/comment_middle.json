    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several key changes are needed:\n1.  **Overall Layout & Text:** Reduce the font size of the main title ('Ukraine War Twitter Engagement...') and add vertical padding between it and the subplots to eliminate overlap and improve visual hierarchy. Ensure all plots consistently represent the full 65-day period on their time axes.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Daily Tweet Volume:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Correct the implementation to use a line chart for 'Daily Tweet Volume' and a bar chart for 'Avg Engagement Score' as requested.\n    *   **Data & Axes:** Rescale the 'Tweet Count' y-axis to reflect the true data range; the current [0.96, 1.04] scale is incorrect and flattens the data. Fix the x-axis tick label overlap by either rotating the labels 45 degrees or reducing their frequency (e.g., show one label per week).\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Sentiment Evolution:**\n    *   **Annotations:** Move the 'Bubble size = Quote Count' text into the legend box or place it as a subtitle for the plot to avoid overlapping the chart's border.\n    *   **Colors:** Use more saturated colors for the lines to improve their visibility and distinguishability against the grid.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Daily Tweet Intensity:**\n    *   **Heatmap:** Re-implement this chart as a proper heatmap. The background color of each cell (day) should correspond to the tweet intensity, using a continuous and sequential color gradient (e.g., light yellow to dark red). The current two-block background is not a heatmap.\n    *   **Clarity:** The color bar should be clearly labeled 'Tweet Intensity' and correspond to the heatmap colors. The secondary y-axis should be clearly labeled to represent the values for the overlaid line plots (e.g., 'Hashtag Count').\n5.  **Data & Colors:** Ensure all 8 required search terms are included. Create a single, consistent color palette with 8 distinct, high-contrast colors to represent these terms and apply it consistently across subplots (0, 0) and (1, 0)."
