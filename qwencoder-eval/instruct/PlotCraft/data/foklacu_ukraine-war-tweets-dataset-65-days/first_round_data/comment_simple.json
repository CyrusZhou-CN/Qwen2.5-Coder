    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Chart Type:** The fundamental issue is the chart type. Change the visualization from a scatter plot to a line chart (`plt.plot()`) to properly show the evolution of engagement over time for each search term.\n2. **Axes Correction:** Swap the x and y axes. The x-axis must represent 'Time' (e.g., 'Date'), and the y-axis must represent 'Tweet Engagement'.\n3. **Text Content:**\n   - **Title:** Replace the incorrect title 'Banana Prices in Atlantis' with the one requested, such as 'Public Engagement with Ukraine War Topics Over Time'.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Correct the axis labels to 'Date' or 'Time' for the x-axis and 'Total Engagement (Replies, Retweets, Likes)' for the y-axis.\n   - **Legend:** Update the legend labels from the generic 'Glarbnok 0', 'Glarbnok 1', etc., to the actual search terms they represent.\n4. **Color Palette:** Replace the harsh neon color palette with a more professional, less saturated, and colorblind-friendly set of colors. Standard palettes like 'viridis', 'plasma', or a custom-defined professional palette would be more appropriate.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Switch to a professional, clean style with a white background (e.g., `plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')` or `plt.style.use('default')`).\n   - If using a grid, ensure the gridlines are light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data lines.\n   - Create a clear visual hierarchy by making the chart title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels.\n6. **Legend Placement:** Move the legend to a position outside the main plot area (e.g., 'upper right' with `bbox_to_anchor=(1.1, 1)`) to prevent it from obscuring any data lines."
