## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of tweet engagement (measured by the sum of replyCount, retweetCount, and likeCount) over time for each of the 8 different search terms. Parse the date column to extract hourly timestamps and aggregate the engagement metrics by hour for each dataset. Display all 8 trend lines on a single plot with different colors and include a legend identifying each search term. Add appropriate axis labels and a title that highlights how public engagement with different Ukraine war-related topics changed throughout the day.
