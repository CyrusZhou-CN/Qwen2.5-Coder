# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between credit card spending amounts and temporal patterns across different cities in India. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a scatter plot showing the correlation between transaction amounts and dates (converted to numerical format), with different colors representing different cities, and (2) a correlation heatmap displaying the relationship matrix between numerical variables including amount, month extracted from date, and city encoded as numerical values. Add trend lines to the scatter plot and ensure proper color coding and legends for both visualizations.
