    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the complete failure to adhere to the task instructions; the entire set of charts must be regenerated. However, to improve the *generated* chart:\n\n1.  **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the vertical and horizontal spacing between all subplots using a function like `plt.tight_layout()` or by manually adjusting `hspace` and `wspace` in `fig.subplots_adjust()`. This will prevent titles from overlapping with plots and create a more balanced layout.\n2.  **Address Critical Overlap:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** The x-axis labels are unreadable. Rotate them by 90 degrees (`plt.xticks(rotation=90)`) or, if they represent dates, reformat them to be more compact (e.g., 'YY-MM') and reduce the number of ticks shown.\n    *   **Subplot (0,2):** The y-axis labels are unreadable due to the high number of categories (cities). Either visualize a smaller subset of cities, significantly increase the figure's height, or choose a different chart type. The text annotations inside the heatmap cells should be removed as they are also illegible.\n3.  **Text and Label Clarity:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** Rotate the x-axis labels (city names) by 30-45 degrees to prevent them from running into each other.\n    *   **Subplot (2,1):** Change the x-axis label from 'Month Index' to actual month names or dates for better interpretability.\n4.  **Color and Legend Improvements:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** This dual-axis plot is confusing. Use two distinct colors for the two lines (e.g., blue for frequency, orange for amount). Match the color of each y-axis label and its ticks to the corresponding line color to make the relationship clear.\n    *   **Consistency:** Use a consistent color palette across all subplots for the same categories. For example, 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Platinum', and 'Signature' should have the same respective colors in subplots (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n5.  **Chart Selection:**\n    *   **Subplot (2,0):** A polar chart is not an effective way to compare categorical counts. Replace it with a standard vertical or horizontal bar chart for much clearer communication."
