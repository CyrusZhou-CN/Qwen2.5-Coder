    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally flawed and cannot be salvaged. It must be recreated from scratch. Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality chart:\n1. **Chart Type and Data:** Create a single histogram. Do not include any other chart types like the pie chart. The x-axis should represent the 'Transaction Amount (Rupees)' and the y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Number of Transactions'.\n2. **Text Content:**\n   - **Title:** Change the title to 'Distribution of Credit Card Transaction Amounts in India'. Make the title bold and a larger font size than other text for clear hierarchy.\n   - **Axis Labels:** Label the x-axis 'Transaction Amount (Rupees)' and the y-axis 'Frequency'.\n   - **Legend:** Remove the legend ('Glarbnok's Revenge') as it is unnecessary for a histogram with a single data series.\n3. **Formatting and Style:**\n   - **Background:** Use a standard white background for the chart.\n   - **Gridlines:** If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines) and preferably only on the y-axis to aid in reading the frequency values.\n   - **Colors:** Use a single, professional color for the histogram bars, such as a muted blue or gray. Avoid neon colors and harsh outlines.\n4. **Data Representation:**\n   - **Bins:** Select an appropriate number of bins to clearly show the shape of the distribution. The current chart shows a heavy skew towards lower amounts, which might be accurate, but the binning could be refined. Consider using a logarithmic scale for the x-axis if the transaction amounts span several orders of magnitude, or focus the chart on the most common range of transaction values.\n5. **Layout:** Ensure there is sufficient white space around the chart elements. The axis labels, tick labels, and title should be clearly legible and not cramped."
