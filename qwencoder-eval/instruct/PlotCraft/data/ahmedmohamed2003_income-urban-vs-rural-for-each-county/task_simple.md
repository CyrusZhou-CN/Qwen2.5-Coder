# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of median household income across all counties in the dataset. Use appropriate bin sizing to reveal the income distribution pattern, add a vertical line indicating the overall mean income, and include proper labels and title. Color the bars to enhance visual appeal and ensure the plot clearly shows whether the income distribution is skewed or normally distributed.
