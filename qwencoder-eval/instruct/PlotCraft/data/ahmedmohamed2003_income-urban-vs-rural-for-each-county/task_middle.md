# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals income disparities between urban and rural counties. Design a horizontal diverging bar chart where each bar represents the deviation of a county's median household income from the overall national average (across all counties in the dataset). Position urban counties above the center line and rural counties below it. Use different colors to distinguish urban (blue) and rural (green) counties, and sort counties by their income deviation magnitude within each group. Add a reference line at zero deviation and include county names as labels for the top 5 and bottom 5 counties with the largest deviations in each category.
