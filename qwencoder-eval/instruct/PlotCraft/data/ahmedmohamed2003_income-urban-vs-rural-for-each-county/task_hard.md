# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing income deviations and disparities across urban vs rural counties. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Population Analysis): 
- Subplot 1: Combine a histogram of total population distribution with overlaid KDE curves, separated by urban/rural classification
- Subplot 2: Create a scatter plot of population vs median income with best-fit lines for each urban/rural group, plus marginal box plots
- Subplot 3: Design a violin plot showing population distribution by urban/rural with overlaid strip plots of individual data points

Middle row (Income Deviation Analysis):
- Subplot 4: Construct diverging bar charts showing how each county's median income deviates from the overall median, colored by urban/rural and sorted by deviation magnitude
- Subplot 5: Build a dumbbell plot comparing urban vs rural median income ranges by state, with error bars showing standard deviation
- Subplot 6: Create a slope chart connecting urban and rural average incomes by state, with diverging colors based on the gap size

Bottom row (Comparative Analysis):
- Subplot 7: Develop a radar chart comparing normalized metrics (population percentile, income percentile, population density proxy) for urban vs rural counties
- Subplot 8: Design a correlation heatmap with hierarchical clustering showing relationships between all numerical variables, annotated with correlation coefficients
- Subplot 9: Construct a bubble plot where x-axis is population, y-axis is income deviation from state average, bubble size represents absolute deviation magnitude, colored by urban/rural classification

Each composite chart should include appropriate legends, color coding for urban/rural distinction, and statistical annotations where relevant.
