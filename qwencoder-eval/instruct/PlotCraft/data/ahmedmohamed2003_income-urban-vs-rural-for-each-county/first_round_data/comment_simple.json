    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally unusable and requires a complete overhaul. The primary issue appears to be data scaling or the presence of extreme outliers/errors.\n\n1.  **Data Preprocessing and Axis Scaling:** The most critical step is to correct the x-axis. The current range (from negative values to 1e8) is incorrect for household income. Filter out any invalid data points (e.g., negative incomes, extreme outliers) and set the x-axis limits to a reasonable range for this variable (e.g., from 0 to $250,000).\n2.  **Binning Strategy:** The current visualization uses only one effective bin. After correcting the data scale, increase the number of bins significantly (e.g., start with `bins=50`) to properly reveal the shape of the income distribution.\n3.  **Axis Label Formatting:** The x-axis tick labels should be formatted for readability, either as plain numbers (e.g., 50000, 100000) or in a currency format (e.g., $50k, $100k). The current scientific notation and negative values are inappropriate.\n4.  **Mean Line Annotation:** The vertical red line representing the mean should be explained. Add a legend or a text annotation (e.g., 'Mean Income') to clarify its meaning.\n5.  **Title Formatting:** Make the main title bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy and distinguish it from the axis labels.\n6.  **Layout and Spacing:** Once the data is plotted correctly, ensure the plot area is used effectively, minimizing excessive white space and creating a balanced composition."
