    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul as it fails on almost every level. \n1. **Data Correction and Scaling**: The most critical issue is the data. The x-axis scale must be corrected to reflect realistic household income deviations (e.g., in dollars or thousands of dollars, not hundreds of millions). The 'National Average' value in the text box also needs to be corrected. \n2. **Implement Correct Chart Type and Layout**: Re-implement the chart as a true horizontal diverging bar chart with a central vertical axis at x=0. Bars for positive deviations should extend to the right, and bars for negative deviations to the left. Correctly plot urban counties (e.g., on the positive y-axis range) and rural counties (on the negative y-axis range) to create the specified 'above/below' layout. \n3. **Fix Labeling**: Remove all current labels. Adhere strictly to the prompt by adding text labels for only the top 5 and bottom 5 counties with the largest deviation magnitude *within each category* (urban and rural). Ensure these labels are positioned to be readable and do not overlap, possibly by adjusting their alignment or using annotation arrows. \n4. **Improve Layout and Spacing**: Drastically change the layout to use the available space effectively. Increase the thickness of the bars so they are clearly visible. Adjust the y-axis limits to space the bars out vertically, preventing them from being squashed at the top and bottom. Reduce the excessive empty space in the center. \n5. **Refine Axes and Reference Lines**: Add a clear, but subtle, vertical reference line at x=0 (e.g., a light gray dashed line) to mark the national average. The y-axis should be treated as a categorical axis, with proper spacing for each county bar shown. The current y-axis is just a line with no ticks and is ineffective."
