## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing international tourism trends from 1995-2018. Each subplot must combine multiple visualization techniques:

Top row: (1) Line chart with confidence bands showing tourism arrivals over time for the top 5 countries by 2018 arrivals, overlaid with scatter points marking significant trend changes; (2) Dual-axis plot combining stacked area chart of tourism expenditures for top 3 spenders with line plot of their departure trends; (3) Heatmap with overlaid contour lines showing the correlation between arrivals and expenditures across all years for countries with complete data.

Middle row: (4) Multi-series line chart with error bars showing tourism expenditure trends for 6 different regional clusters (group countries by expenditure patterns), with shaded recession periods (2001, 2008-2009); (5) Slope chart with connected scatter points showing the relationship between 1995 and 2018 values for arrivals vs departures, sized by total expenditure; (6) Time series decomposition plot combining original expenditure data, trend line, and seasonal components for the top 3 tourism economies.

Bottom row: (7) Bubble chart with trend lines showing the evolution of expenditure per arrival over time, with bubble sizes representing total departures; (8) Multi-panel time series with both absolute values and percentage change year-over-year for arrivals, departures, and expenditures of top 5 countries; (9) Radar chart overlay showing tourism performance metrics (arrivals growth rate, expenditure growth rate, departure growth rate) for different time periods (1995-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2018) for top 10 countries.
