## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 15 countries by international tourism arrivals in 2018. Sort the countries in descending order by arrival numbers, with the highest at the top. Format the y-axis labels to show country names clearly, and format the x-axis to display arrival numbers in millions (e.g., "5.3M" instead of "5340000"). Add a title "Top 15 Countries by International Tourism Arrivals (2018)" and label the x-axis as "Number of Arrivals (Millions)".
