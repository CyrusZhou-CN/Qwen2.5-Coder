    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following changes are recommended:\n1.  **Task Compliance Correction:**\n    *   In subplot (1,0), replace the dot plot on the right with a proper scatter plot to show the required correlation. The x-axis should represent an economic indicator, and the y-axis should represent the outbound tourism growth rate.\n    *   In subplot (1,1), replace the current line chart with a time series decomposition plot, showing separate panels for trend, seasonality, and residuals to meet the prompt's requirement.\n2.  **Text Clarity and Overlap:**\n    *   **Subplot (1,0):** Address the severe text overlap on the left y-axis. Instead of placing all labels at the start points, use direct labeling next to the lines, staggering them vertically to ensure readability. Alternatively, remove the direct labels and use a legend.\n    *   **Subplots (0,0) and (0,1):** Fix the truncated legend text. Widen the legend box or adjust the plot layout to ensure full labels like 'Post-demographic', 'IDA & IBRD total', and 'Late-demographic' are displayed correctly.\n3.  **Axis and Label Consistency:**\n    *   In subplot (1,1), the y-axis label 'Tourist Flows (Billions)' is ambiguous and likely incorrect in its unit. The values on the axis (0.5 to 4.0) are inconsistent with the 'Millions' used in other plots. The label should be clarified (e.g., 'Global Arrivals/Departures (Millions)') and the data scaled correctly to be consistent with subplot (0,0).\n4.  **Legend Optimization:**\n    *   In subplot (0,0), the legend is very crowded with 11 entries. To improve readability, consider using direct labeling for the top 3-4 lines and grouping the remaining, less prominent lines into an 'Other' category or displaying them with lower visual weight (e.g., light gray)."
