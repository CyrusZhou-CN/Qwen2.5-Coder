    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, first address the task compliance failures: (1) In subplot (0,0), add the required scatter points to mark significant trend changes. (2) In subplot (0,2), overlay contour lines on the heatmap. (3) In subplot (1,0), add error bars to the multi-series line chart. (4) Redesign subplot (1,1) to be a proper slope chart comparing 1995 arrivals vs. 1995 departures on one axis and 2018 values on the other, with point sizes reflecting total expenditure. (5) In subplot (1,2), include the seasonal component in the time series decomposition. (6) Recreate subplot (2,1) as a multi-panel chart with separate panels for absolute values and year-over-year percentage change. \n\nFor visual quality enhancements: (1) Increase the vertical spacing between subplot rows (e.g., using `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`) to eliminate the overlap between titles and the plots above them. (2) Add a main, overarching title (suptitle) to the entire 3x3 grid to provide context. (3) In subplot (2,0), move the legend to the 'upper right' or outside the plot area to prevent it from obscuring the data bubbles. Consider reducing the bubble `alpha` to improve clarity where they overlap. (4) In subplot (0,2), adjust the left margin or reduce font size to ensure full country names are displayed on the y-axis without abbreviation. (5) In subplot (1,2), simplify the legend by using different line styles (e.g., solid for original, dashed for trend) for each color-coded category, reducing the number of legend entries by half."
