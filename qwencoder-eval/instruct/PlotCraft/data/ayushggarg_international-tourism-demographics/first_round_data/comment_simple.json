    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data Correction and Sorting**: The most critical issue is the data. The chart must be regenerated using the correct data for the top 15 countries by international tourism arrivals in 2018. The data must then be sorted in descending order, so the country with the most arrivals is at the top.\n2. **X-Axis Formatting**: The x-axis tick labels must be reformatted to show values in millions, as specified in the prompt. For example, `100,000,000` should be displayed as '100M', `20,000,000` as '20M', and so on. This is a direct violation of the instructions.\n3. **Title Formatting**: To improve the visual hierarchy, the main title 'Top 15 Countries by International Tourism Arrivals (2018)' should be made more prominent by using a slightly larger font size and a bold font weight.\n4. **Data Labels**: To enhance readability and provide precise information, consider adding data labels (the exact number in millions) at the end of each bar. This would make it easier for the viewer to read the values without referring to the x-axis."
