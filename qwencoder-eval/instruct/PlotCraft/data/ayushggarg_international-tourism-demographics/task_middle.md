## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of international tourism patterns from 1995 to 2018. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Line chart with error bands showing the trend and variability of tourism arrivals over time for the top 10 countries by 2018 arrivals, overlaid with a secondary y-axis showing the global average trend; (2) Top-right: Stacked area chart displaying tourism expenditures evolution for major tourism spenders, with a line plot overlay showing the expenditure-to-arrivals ratio trend; (3) Bottom-left: Slope chart comparing tourism departures between 2000 and 2018 for countries with complete data, combined with scatter points showing the correlation between economic development (inferred from expenditure patterns) and outbound tourism growth; (4) Bottom-right: Time series decomposition-style plot showing seasonal patterns in tourism data by combining arrival and departure trends with highlighted periods of significant global events (2001, 2008 financial crisis) using different colored background regions.
