## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of COVID-19 confirmed cases over time across different countries. Use the most recent forecast file (2022-02-22) and plot the 'confirmed' cases on the y-axis against the 'ds' (date) on the x-axis. Color-code each country's line differently and include a legend. Add appropriate title, axis labels, and ensure the date format is readable on the x-axis.
