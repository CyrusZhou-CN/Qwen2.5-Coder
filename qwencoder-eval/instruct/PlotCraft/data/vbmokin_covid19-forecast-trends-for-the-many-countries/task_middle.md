## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing the evolution of COVID-19 forecast trends across multiple countries. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A multi-line time series plot showing the 'confirmed' cases over time ('ds') for the top 5 countries with highest average confirmed cases, with each country represented by a different colored line and including confidence intervals using 'yhat_lower' and 'yhat_upper' as shaded areas; (2) Top-right: A stacked area chart displaying the cumulative 'trend' component over time for all countries, showing how the underlying trend patterns stack up across nations; (3) Bottom-left: A line plot with dual y-axes showing both the 'weekly' multiplicative terms (left axis) and 'holidays' additive terms (right axis) over time, averaged across all countries to reveal seasonal and holiday impact patterns; (4) Bottom-right: A slope chart comparing the first and last forecast values of 'confirmed' cases for each country, connected by lines to show the overall trajectory change from the earliest to latest forecast periods in the dataset.
