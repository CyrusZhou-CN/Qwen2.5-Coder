    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address any aspect of the user's request. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Task:** The primary goal is to fulfill the user's prompt. This means creating a 2x2 subplot grid focused on COVID-19 forecast data.\n2.  **Correct Layout and Chart Types:**\n    *   Implement a 2x2 grid layout.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a multi-line time series plot with a secondary y-axis.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a stacked area chart with transparent error bands.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Create a slope chart combined with box plots.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create a combination chart with bars, a line, and scatter points.\n3.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background with subtle, light gray gridlines to ensure data is the primary focus.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Replace the neon colors with a professional, harmonious color palette. Use distinct but not jarring colors to differentiate categories (e.g., countries).\n    *   **Text Content:** All text must be corrected. The main title should relate to 'COVID-19 Forecast Analysis'. Each subplot should have a descriptive title. Axis labels must be accurate and legible.\n    *   **Remove Obstructions:** Eliminate all overlapping and placeholder text ('OVERLAPPING TEXT HERE', 'BLOCKING TEXT'). Ensure all elements, including legends, are placed in a way that does not obscure data.\n    *   **Visual Hierarchy:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title should be the most prominent, followed by subplot titles, then axis labels. Use font weight (e.g., bold) and size to create this distinction."
