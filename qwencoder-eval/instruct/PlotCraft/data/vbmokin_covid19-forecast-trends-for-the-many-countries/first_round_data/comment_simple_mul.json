Follow these steps to create the correct chart:\n\n1.  **Start Over:** Create a new, single-panel chart (a 1x1 layout).\n2.  **Chart Type:** Use a line chart as the sole chart type.\n3.  **Data Plotting:**\n    *   The x-axis should represent 'Date'.\n    *   The y-axis should represent 'Confirmed Cases'.\n    *   Plot three separate lines on this single chart, where each line corresponds to the data from one of the specified forecast periods (2021-01-24, 2021-06-15, and 2021-12-07).\n4.  **Titles and Labels:**\n    *   Set the main title to be descriptive and accurate, such as 'Evolution of COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Forecasts'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Date' and the y-axis as 'Confirmed Cases'.\n5.  **Legend:**\n    *   Include a legend to clearly distinguish the three lines.\n    *   Label the legend entries with their corresponding forecast dates (e.g., 'Forecast: 2021-01-24').\n    *   Place the legend in a non-obstructive location, such as the top-right or top-left corner of the plot area.\n6.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for a clean, professional look.\n    *   If gridlines are used, make them subtle (light gray and thin).\n    *   Choose a professional and harmonious color palette for the three lines (e.g., blue, orange, green) instead of the current neon colors.\n    *   Ensure all text is legible and that there is a clear visual hierarchy (e.g., bold title)."
