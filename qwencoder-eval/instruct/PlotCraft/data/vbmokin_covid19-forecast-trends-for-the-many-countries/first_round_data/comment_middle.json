    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and has no relation to the prompt. It must be discarded and created from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:** Generate a multi-line time series plot for 'confirmed' cases vs. 'ds' for the top 5 countries. Use different colors for each country's line and add shaded areas between 'yhat_lower' and 'yhat_upper' for confidence intervals. Include a legend and a clear title like 'Confirmed Cases Forecast for Top 5 Countries'.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** Generate a stacked area chart showing the cumulative 'trend' component over time for all countries. Add a legend to identify the countries and a title such as 'Cumulative Trend Component Across Countries'.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:** Create a line plot with dual y-axes. Plot the average 'weekly' terms on the left y-axis and the average 'holidays' terms on the right y-axis, both against time. Clearly label both axes and provide a title like 'Average Seasonal and Holiday Effects'.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** Implement a slope chart. For each country, plot a point for the first forecast value and another for the last, connecting them with a line. The x-axis should be categorical (e.g., 'Start of Forecast', 'End of Forecast'). Label the lines or endpoints with country names and add a title like 'Forecast Trajectory Change by Country'.\n6.  **General Formatting:** Use a professional style with a white background. Select a harmonious color palette. Ensure all text (titles, axis labels, legends) is clear, correctly spelled, and positioned without any overlap. Use `plt.tight_layout()` to ensure proper spacing between subplots."
