    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet any part of the user's request. The primary focus should be on actually fulfilling the prompt.\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Task Prompt:** The entire visualization must be discarded and rebuilt using the specified COVID-19 forecast data. All placeholder data and nonsensical labels must be replaced with relevant information.\n2.  **Correct the Layout:** Implement the required 3x3 subplot grid. Use a function like `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(3, 3)` and ensure proper spacing between plots using `fig.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()` to prevent overlap.\n3.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:** For each of the nine subplots, from (0, 0) to (2, 2), generate the specific composite visualization as detailed in the instruction. For example, in subplot (0, 0), combine a line plot, `fill_between` for error bands, and a scatter plot for actual values.\n4.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Use a standard white background. Replace the current garish color palette with a professional, harmonious, and colorblind-friendly scheme (e.g., from Seaborn or ColorBrewer).\n    *   **Typography:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main figure title should be the largest and boldest, followed by subplot titles, and then axis labels. Use a standard, readable font.\n5.  **Ensure Clarity:**\n    *   **Eliminate Overlap:** Adjust font sizes, element positioning, and subplot spacing to ensure no text or data elements overlap.\n    *   **Meaningful Labels:** All titles, axis labels, and legends must be corrected to accurately describe the COVID-19 data being presented (e.g., 'Date', 'Confirmed Cases', 'Prediction Error by Country'). Remove all nonsensical text like 'MAXIMUM CONFUSION' and 'OVERLAPPING TEXT CHAOS'."
