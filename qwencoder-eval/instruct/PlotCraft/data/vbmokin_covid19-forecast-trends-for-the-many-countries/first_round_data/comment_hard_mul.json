    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and has no relation to the user's task. It cannot be improved; it must be discarded and created from scratch. A new chart should be generated that adheres to the following core requirements from the prompt:\n\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 3x2 subplot grid (3 rows, 2 columns).\n2.  **Data:** Use the correct COVID-19 forecast data as specified.\n3.  **Top Row Charts:** For the top row subplots, generate overlaid line charts. Use solid lines for 'actual confirmed cases' and dashed lines for 'predicted trends'. Use a function like `fill_between` to show the confidence interval bands ('yhat_lower' to 'yhat_upper'). Assign a distinct color to each of the 3 countries plotted in each subplot.\n4.  **Bottom Row Charts:** For the bottom row subplots, create dual-axis charts. On the primary y-axis, plot stacked area charts for 'weekly multiplicative terms'. On the secondary y-axis, plot line charts for 'trend components'.\n5.  **Content & Labeling:** Ensure each subplot represents the correct time periods and countries. All titles, axis labels, and legends must be accurate and relevant to the COVID-19 data being displayed.\n6.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for the entire figure.\n    *   Employ a professional and harmonious color palette (e.g., from ColorBrewer or Seaborn's default palettes). Avoid neon or overly saturated colors.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title should be bold and larger than subplot titles, which should be larger than axis labels.\n    *   Ensure all text is black or dark gray for maximum readability.\n    *   Remove all overlapping elements and ensure adequate spacing between subplots for a clean, organized appearance."
