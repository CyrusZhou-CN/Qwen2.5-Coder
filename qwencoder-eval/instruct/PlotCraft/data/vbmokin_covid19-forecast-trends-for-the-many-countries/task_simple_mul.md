## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the evolution of COVID-19 confirmed cases over time for all countries. Use data from three different forecast periods (2021-01-24, 2021-06-15, and 2021-12-07) to demonstrate how the forecasting trends changed across different time periods. Plot the confirmed cases (y-axis) against the date (x-axis), with different colored lines for each forecast period. Include a legend to distinguish between the three forecast periods and add appropriate title and axis labels.
