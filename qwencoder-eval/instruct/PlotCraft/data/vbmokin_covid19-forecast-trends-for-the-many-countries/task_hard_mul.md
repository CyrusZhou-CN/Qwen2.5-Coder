# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing COVID-19 forecast trends across multiple time periods and countries. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): For each subplot, select 3 different countries and create overlaid line charts showing both actual confirmed cases and predicted trends over time, with confidence interval bands (yhat_lower to yhat_upper) as filled areas. Use different colors for each country and include both solid lines for actual values and dashed lines for predictions.

Bottom row (3 subplots): For each subplot, create dual-axis composite charts where the primary y-axis shows stacked area charts of weekly multiplicative terms for 4 different countries, and the secondary y-axis overlays line charts showing the trend components for the same countries. Each subplot should represent a different time period (early 2021, mid-2021, and late 2021/early 2022).

Use data from at least 6 different forecast files spanning from early 2021 to early 2022 to show the evolution of COVID-19 forecasting patterns. Include proper legends, axis labels, and subplot titles indicating the time periods and countries being analyzed.
