## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis visualization showing how COVID-19 cases and deaths evolved between the two time periods (August 28, 2021 and August 31, 2021) across different WHO regions. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left shows a slope chart comparing cumulative cases per 100,000 population between the two dates for each WHO region, (2) Top-right displays a slope chart for cumulative deaths per 100,000 population changes by WHO region, (3) Bottom-left presents a combined bar and line chart showing newly reported cases in last 7 days per 100,000 population for both dates with percentage change indicators, and (4) Bottom-right shows a similar combined visualization for newly reported deaths in last 7 days per 100,000 population. Include proper annotations highlighting the regions with the most significant changes and ensure all charts have consistent color coding by WHO region.
