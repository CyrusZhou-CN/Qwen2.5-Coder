It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\nTo fulfill the request, a new chart should be created with the following characteristics:\n1.  **Chart Type & Layout:** Create a single horizontal bar chart in a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data & Sorting:** Identify the top 15 countries by 'Cases - cumulative total per 100,000 population' from the specified data file. Plot these countries on the y-axis and their case rates on the x-axis. Sort the bars in descending order, with the country having the highest rate at the top.\n3.  **Styling & Formatting:**\n    *   Adopt a professional and clean visual style, such as 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', which uses a white background and subtle gray gridlines.\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (e.g., steel blue or gray) for all bars to maintain a professional appearance.\n    *   Set a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Top 15 Countries by Cumulative COVID-19 Cases per 100,000 Population'. Make the title bold and slightly larger than other text elements to establish a visual hierarchy.\n    *   Label the x-axis clearly as 'Cumulative Cases per 100,000 Population'.\n    *   Format the x-axis tick labels to be more readable, for example, by displaying large numbers in thousands (e.g., '10k', '15k').\n4.  **Final Polish:** Use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` to ensure all elements, especially the country names on the y-axis, are fully visible and not cut off."
