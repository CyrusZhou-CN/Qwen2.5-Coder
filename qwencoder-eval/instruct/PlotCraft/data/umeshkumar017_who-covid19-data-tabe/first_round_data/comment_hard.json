    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure to follow the prompt and cannot be improved; it must be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1. **Adhere to the Task:** The primary goal is to create a chart that actually follows the user's instructions. The entire current output should be discarded.\n2. **Data and Topic:** Use COVID-19 data as specified in the prompt, focusing on the dates August 28, 2021, and August 31, 2021.\n3. **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid as requested.\n4. **Chart Types:** Implement the specific, complex chart types for each subplot as detailed in the prompt:\n    - **Subplot (0, 0):** A dual-axis plot (bar chart + line plot).\n    - **Subplot (0, 1):** A scatter plot with marginal histograms.\n    - **Subplot (1, 0):** A slope chart overlaid with a violin plot.\n    - **Subplot (1, 1):** A bubble chart with a heatmap background.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n    - Use a white or light gray background for all subplots.\n    - If gridlines are used, they should be thin and light gray to avoid distracting from the data.\n    - Establish a clear visual hierarchy with a bold main title for the entire figure and appropriately sized, non-bold titles for each subplot and axis.\n    - Choose a professional and harmonious color palette. Use color meaningfully to distinguish categories (e.g., WHO regions) and ensure good contrast and readability.\n6. **Text Content:** All text, including titles, axis labels, legends, and annotations, must be accurate and relevant to the COVID-19 data being presented."
