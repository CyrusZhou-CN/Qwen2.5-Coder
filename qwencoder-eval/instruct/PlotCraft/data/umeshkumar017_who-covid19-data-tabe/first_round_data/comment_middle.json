It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n1. **Adhere to the Prompt:** The primary step is to follow the task instructions precisely. \n2. **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid. \n3. **Data and Content:** Use the correct COVID-19 data for WHO regions between the specified dates. The titles, axis labels, and all text must be relevant to this data. \n4. **Chart Types:** \n   - Implement slope charts in subplots (0, 0) and (0, 1) to show changes in cumulative cases and deaths per 100k population. \n   - Implement combined bar and line charts in subplots (1, 0) and (1, 1) for newly reported cases and deaths, including percentage change indicators. \n5. **Formatting and Professionalism:** \n   - Use a professional, publication-ready format: a white background, subtle gray gridlines, and black or dark gray text. \n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than axis labels. \n6. **Color Scheme:** \n   - Select a clear, distinct, and professional color palette to represent each WHO region. This color coding must be consistent across all four subplots. \n7. **Clarity:** \n   - Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or manually adjust subplot spacing (`subplots_adjust`) to provide adequate room for titles, labels, and annotations. \n   - Add the required annotations to highlight regions with significant changes, placing them carefully so they do not obscure data."
