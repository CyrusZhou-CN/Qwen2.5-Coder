# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of COVID-19 metrics between two time points (August 28, 2021 and August 31, 2021). Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Create a dual-axis plot showing both the absolute change in cumulative cases (bar chart) and the percentage change in cases per 100,000 population (line plot with markers) for the top 15 countries by total cases, with error bars representing the weekly reporting variance.

Top-right: Develop a scatter plot with marginal histograms showing the relationship between change in cumulative deaths and change in weekly new cases, with points sized by population density (derived from cases per 100,000) and colored by WHO region, including trend lines for each region.

Bottom-left: Construct a slope chart overlaid with a violin plot showing the distribution of changes in weekly case rates per 100,000 population across WHO regions, with individual country trajectories connected by lines and regional distributions shown as violin plots on the sides.

Bottom-right: Design a bubble chart combined with a heatmap background showing countries positioned by their change in weekly deaths per 100,000 (x-axis) vs change in weekly cases per 100,000 (y-axis), with bubble sizes representing total population (inferred from cumulative totals and rates), and background heatmap showing density of countries in each quadrant of change patterns.
