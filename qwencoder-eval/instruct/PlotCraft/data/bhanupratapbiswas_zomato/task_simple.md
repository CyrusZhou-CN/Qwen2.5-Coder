# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of restaurant ratings in the Zomato dataset. Extract the numeric rating values from the 'rate' column (which contains ratings in format like "4.1/5"), convert them to float values, and visualize their distribution using a histogram with appropriate bins. Include proper axis labels, title, and ensure the visualization clearly shows the frequency of different rating ranges among the restaurants.
