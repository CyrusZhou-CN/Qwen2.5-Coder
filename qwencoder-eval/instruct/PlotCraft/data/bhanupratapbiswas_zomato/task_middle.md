## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between restaurant ratings and cost in the Zomato dataset. Design a scatter plot with restaurant ratings (y-axis) versus approximate cost for two people (x-axis), where each point is colored by the restaurant type (rest_type). Overlay a regression line to show the overall trend between cost and ratings. Additionally, add marginal histograms on the top and right sides of the scatter plot to show the distribution of cost and ratings respectively.
