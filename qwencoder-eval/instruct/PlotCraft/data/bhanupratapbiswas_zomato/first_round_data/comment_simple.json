    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet professional standards and fulfill the task. \n1. **Correct Core Errors:** Swap the axes. The x-axis should be 'Rating Value' and the y-axis should be 'Number of Restaurants' (or 'Frequency').\n2. **Remove All Extraneous Elements:** Delete the overlaid pie chart, the text 'How Many Stars in the Sky', the pie chart labels ('2.4-2.7', etc.), and the legend 'Glarbnok's Revenge'. These elements are irrelevant and create extreme clutter.\n3. **Revise Text Content:** Change the title to 'Distribution of Restaurant Ratings' to accurately reflect the data. Ensure axis labels are correct and clearly legible.\n4. **Adopt a Professional Color Scheme:** Switch to a standard white background. Use a single, neutral color (e.g., medium gray or blue) for the histogram bars. Remove the harsh red outlines. If gridlines are used, they should be very light gray and subtle.\n5. **Establish Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to guide the viewer's attention.\n6. **Simplify Formatting:** Remove the heavy chart borders and use a clean, minimalist style that focuses attention on the data itself."
