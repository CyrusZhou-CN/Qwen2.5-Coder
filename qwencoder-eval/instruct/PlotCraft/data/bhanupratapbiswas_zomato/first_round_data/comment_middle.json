    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be completely regenerated from scratch. \n1. **Correct Chart Structure:** Remove the pie chart entirely. Create a single composite visualization using a joint plot structure, with a central scatter plot, a histogram on the top margin, and a histogram on the right margin.\n2. **Correct Data Mapping:** \n   - Scatter plot (center): Map the x-axis to 'Approximate cost for two people' and the y-axis to 'Restaurant ratings'.\n   - Color scatter points by 'rest_type'.\n   - Top histogram: Show the distribution of 'Approximate cost for two people'.\n   - Right histogram: Show the distribution of 'Restaurant ratings'.\n3. **Add Required Elements:** Overlay a regression line on the central scatter plot to illustrate the trend.\n4. **Improve Text and Labels:** \n   - Use a clear main title like 'Relationship Between Restaurant Cost and Ratings'.\n   - Label the axes correctly (e.g., 'Approximate Cost for Two', 'Aggregate Rating').\n   - Ensure the legend accurately lists the restaurant types and is placed outside the main plot area to avoid obstruction.\n5. **Enhance Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a white background for a clean, professional look.\n   - If gridlines are used, make them light gray and subtle.\n   - Select a professional, harmonious color palette for the restaurant types. Avoid the current neon colors.\n   - Ensure the main title is bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
