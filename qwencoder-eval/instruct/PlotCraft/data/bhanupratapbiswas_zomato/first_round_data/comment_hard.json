    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul of its layout and corrections to several subplots. \n1. **Overall Layout:** Increase the overall figure size significantly and use a layout manager to add substantial padding between subplots (e.g., `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6, wspace=0.4)`). This is the most critical fix to address the cramped appearance and overlapping elements.\n2. **Subplot (0, 1):** Re-implement this plot using a method like `GridSpec` to create a main axis for the scatter plot and two smaller, adjacent axes on the top and right to accommodate the required marginal box plots.\n3. **Subplot (1, 1):** This plot must be fixed. The violin plot is likely squashed due to outliers in the cost data; consider applying a log scale to the y-axis (`ax.set_yscale('log')`) to handle the skew and allow the violins to be visible. Rotate the x-axis labels 90 degrees (`ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)`) to make them readable. Change the y-axis title to 'Cost'.\n4. **Subplot (2, 1):** To meet the 'segmented' requirement, this should be changed from one large heatmap into four smaller heatmaps, one for each service combination (Online/Book, Online/No Book, etc.). Arrange these in a 2x2 grid within the subplot's area and use a single, shared color bar.\n5. **Text and Annotations:**\n   - In subplot (1, 0), use a library like `adjustText` to position the bubble labels automatically to prevent them from overlapping.\n   - In subplot (1, 2), remove the incorrect 'Restaurant Count' y-axis label. The axes of a radar chart are the spokes, which are already labeled.\n   - In subplot (2, 2), change the y-axis label from 'Encoded Values' to something more descriptive like 'Normalized Value'.\n6. **Formatting Refinements:**\n   - In subplots (0, 0) and (0, 2), change the color of the secondary axis labels, ticks, and title from bright red to a more subtle dark gray to reduce visual distraction.\n   - Ensure all plot titles have consistent font size, weight, and padding above the plot area."
