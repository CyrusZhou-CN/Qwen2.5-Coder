## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis visualization showing how London Underground station usage patterns evolved from 2007 to 2017. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A line chart showing the trend of total annual entries+exits (in millions) over time for the top 10 busiest stations in 2017, with each station represented by a different colored line; (2) Top-right: A stacked area chart displaying the cumulative weekday vs weekend (Saturday + Sunday) entry patterns over the years for the entire tube system; (3) Bottom-left: A slope chart comparing 2007 vs 2017 weekday entry volumes for the 15 stations with the largest percentage change; (4) Bottom-right: A multi-line chart showing the seasonal usage patterns by plotting average monthly usage trends, where each line represents a different year from 2007-2017, revealing how usage patterns shifted over the decade.
