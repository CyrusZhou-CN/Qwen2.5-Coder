# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing London Underground station usage evolution from 2007-2017. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2007-2009 vs 2015-2017 comparison):
- Subplot 1: Overlay a scatter plot of weekday entries vs exits with a regression line, plus marginal histograms showing the distribution of entries and exits for 2007-2009 period
- Subplot 2: Same composite chart structure but for 2015-2017 period to show the evolution

Middle row (Temporal trends):
- Subplot 3: Multi-line time series showing the top 10 busiest stations' annual usage evolution from 2007-2017, with error bands representing the variance between weekday/weekend usage
- Subplot 4: Stacked area chart showing the cumulative contribution of different boroughs to total system usage over time, overlaid with a line chart showing the year-over-year growth rate

Bottom row (Usage pattern analysis):
- Subplot 5: Violin plots showing the distribution of weekend vs weekday usage ratios across all stations for each year, overlaid with box plots to highlight median and quartiles
- Subplot 6: Heatmap showing the correlation matrix between different usage metrics (weekday/Saturday/Sunday entries/exits) across years, with a dendrogram on the side showing hierarchical clustering of years based on usage patterns

Use consistent color schemes across subplots and ensure each composite chart effectively combines at least two different visualization types to reveal complex temporal patterns in London Underground usage.
