## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis of London Underground station usage patterns from 2007 to 2017. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization elements: (1) Top-left: Line chart showing the evolution of total annual entries+exits for the top 10 busiest stations over the decade, with each station represented by a different colored line and overlaid scatter points marking actual data points; (2) Top-right: Stacked area chart displaying the cumulative contribution of weekday vs weekend (Saturday + Sunday) usage patterns across all years, showing how the proportion of weekend vs weekday usage has changed over time; (3) Bottom-left: Combined bar and line plot showing annual system-wide total usage (bars) with a trend line overlay, plus error bars indicating the standard deviation of usage across all stations for each year; (4) Bottom-right: Heatmap showing the year-over-year percentage change in usage for the top 15 stations, with a color gradient from red (decrease) to green (increase), and overlaid text annotations showing the exact percentage values.
