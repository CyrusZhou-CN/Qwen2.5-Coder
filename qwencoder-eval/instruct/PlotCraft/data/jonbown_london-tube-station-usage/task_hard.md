# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of London Underground station usage from 2007-2017. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (2007-2009): For each year, create a scatter plot showing the relationship between weekday entries and annual usage (in millions), with bubble sizes representing weekend activity levels (Saturday + Sunday entries), overlaid with a regression line and confidence intervals.

Middle row (2010-2012): For each year, create a dual-axis plot combining a histogram of annual usage distribution with a KDE curve overlay, and add vertical lines marking the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of usage.

Bottom row (2013-2015): For each year, create a combination plot showing both a box plot of weekday vs weekend entry ratios by borough (grouped by top 10 boroughs by station count) and overlay violin plots to show the distribution density.

Each subplot should include year-specific titles, appropriate color schemes that evolve across the timeline, and statistical annotations (correlation coefficients for scatter plots, percentile values for histograms, and median values for box plots). The overall visualization should reveal how station usage patterns, distributions, and borough-level variations evolved during this decade.
