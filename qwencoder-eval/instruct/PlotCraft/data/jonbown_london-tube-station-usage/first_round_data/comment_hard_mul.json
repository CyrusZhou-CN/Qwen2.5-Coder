    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and has no relation to the task prompt. It cannot be improved; it must be discarded and recreated from scratch. A new chart should be generated that adheres to the following:\n\n1.  **Adherence to Prompt:** The primary action is to follow the user's instructions. The new chart must analyze London Underground usage data from 2007-2017.\n2.  **Layout:** Implement the correct 3x2 grid layout (3 rows, 2 columns).\n3.  **Chart Types and Content:** Each subplot must contain the specific composite visualization requested in the prompt:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Scatter plot (weekday entries vs. exits, 2007-2009) with a regression line and marginal histograms.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Same composite chart as (0, 0), but for the 2015-2017 period.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Multi-line time series (top 10 stations) with error bands.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Stacked area chart (borough contribution) overlaid with a line chart (YoY growth).\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** Violin plots (weekend vs. weekday usage ratios) overlaid with box plots.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Heatmap (correlation matrix) with a dendrogram.\n4.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Use a white background and a professional, harmonious color palette. Avoid the current jarring, high-contrast colors.\n    *   **Text:** All titles, axis labels, and annotations must be accurate, descriptive, and relevant to the London Underground data. Remove all placeholder text and nonsensical labels.\n    *   **Clarity:** Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. Remove all watermarks.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** Create a clear visual hierarchy with a main title for the entire 3x2 grid and distinct, informative titles for each of the six subplots."
