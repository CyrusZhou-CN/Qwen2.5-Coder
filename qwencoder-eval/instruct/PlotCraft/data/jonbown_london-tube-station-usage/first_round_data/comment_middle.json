    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address any part of the user's request. It must be discarded and created from scratch. \n\n1.  **Adhere to the Prompt:** The entire visualization needs to be recreated to match the task instructions. This includes using the correct data (London Underground usage), layout (2x2 grid), and chart types for each subplot.\n2.  **Layout:** Implement a 2x2 subplot grid. Use `plt.subplots(2, 2)` or an equivalent function and ensure adequate spacing between plots using `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`.\n3.  **Chart Types and Data:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a line chart showing the trend of total annual entries+exits for the top 10 stations. Each station should have a distinct line color and be identified in a legend.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a stacked area chart showing cumulative weekday vs. weekend entries over the years.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Create a slope chart comparing 2007 vs. 2017 weekday entry volumes for the specified stations.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create a multi-line chart for seasonal usage, with each line representing a year.\n4.  **Text Content:** All titles, axis labels, and legends must be accurate and descriptive of the London Underground data being presented. For example, the title for subplot (0,0) could be 'Annual Usage for Top 10 Busiest Stations (2007-2017)' and its axes should be 'Year' and 'Total Entries & Exits (Millions)'.\n5.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a white background for all plots (`facecolor='white'`).\n    *   Use a clean and harmonious color palette. Avoid overly saturated primary colors.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main title for the entire figure should be larger and bolder than the subplot titles. Subplot titles should be more prominent than axis labels.\n    *   Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements. All text, legends, and data points must be clearly visible."
