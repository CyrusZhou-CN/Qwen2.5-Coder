    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and does not address the prompt in any way. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. To meet the requirements, the following steps are necessary:\n\n1.  **Layout and Structure:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid. This is the fundamental structure required by the prompt.\n2.  **Data and Chart Implementation:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Generate a line chart showing the usage of the top 10 stations over time. Overlay scatter points on the lines. Use a legend to distinguish the 10 stations.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Generate a stacked area chart to show the proportion of weekday vs. weekend usage over the years.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Generate a bar chart for total annual usage. Overlay a line plot for the trend and add error bars to the bars representing the standard deviation.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Generate a heatmap showing the year-over-year percentage change for the top 15 stations. Use a diverging colormap (e.g., red for decrease, green for increase) and annotate each cell with the percentage value.\n3.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Use a standard white background. Replace the harsh neon colors with a professional, harmonious color palette (e.g., a default seaborn or matplotlib palette like 'tab10' or 'viridis').\n    *   **Text and Titles:** Ensure all titles and labels are relevant to the London Underground data. The main title should be bold and larger than subplot titles and axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Spacing:** Use `plt.tight_layout()` or similar functions to ensure there is no overlap between subplots, titles, and labels.\n    *   **Clarity:** Remove all placeholder text like 'OVERLAPPING TEXT' and replace it with meaningful data annotations as specified in the prompt."
