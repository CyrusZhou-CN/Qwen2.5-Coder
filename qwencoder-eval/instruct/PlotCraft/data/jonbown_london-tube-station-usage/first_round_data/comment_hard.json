    "improvement_suggestions": "The fundamental issue is the complete absence of data visualization. The chart is merely a well-formatted empty template. To meet the task requirements, the following must be implemented:\n\n1.  **Data Plotting:** The primary step is to plot the data for each subplot according to the prompt's instructions.\n2.  **Top Row (Subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)):**\n    *   Implement the scatter plot showing the relationship between weekday entries and annual usage.\n    *   Use bubble size to represent weekend activity levels.\n    *   Overlay the regression line and its corresponding confidence interval.\n    *   Add a text annotation in a corner of each subplot displaying the correlation coefficient (e.g., 'r = 0.XX').\n3.  **Middle Row (Subplots (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)):**\n    *   Create the histogram for the annual usage distribution.\n    *   Overlay a smooth Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve on a secondary y-axis.\n    *   Add distinct vertical lines to mark the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles. These lines should be clearly labeled, perhaps using a small legend or direct text annotations.\n4.  **Bottom Row (Subplots (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)):**\n    *   Generate the combined box plots and violin plots for the weekday vs. weekend entry ratios.\n    *   Group the data by the top 10 boroughs as specified.\n    *   Set the x-axis ticks to be the names of the boroughs and the y-axis label to 'Weekday/Weekend Entry Ratio'.\n    *   Add text annotations to display the median value for each group.\n5.  **Color Scheme:** Implement an 'evolving' color scheme to visually represent the passage of time. For example, use a sequential colormap where plots for 2007-2009 use shades of blue, 2010-2012 use shades of green/yellow, and 2013-2015 use shades of orange/red.\n6.  **Titles and Labels:** While the subplot titles are good, the main title should be updated to reflect the full 2007-2017 range mentioned in the prompt, or the prompt's inconsistency should be addressed by sticking to 2007-2015 as visualized. Ensure all axes, especially on the bottom row, are correctly and descriptively labeled."
