    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and entirely unrelated to the user's request. It cannot be improved; it must be discarded and recreated from scratch. A new chart should be generated following these steps:\n1. **Fulfill the Core Task:** Create a single line chart as requested. The chart should plot the annual entry/exit totals for the top 5 busiest London Underground stations from 2007 to 2017.\n2. **Layout and Axes:** Use a standard 1x1 layout. The x-axis should be labeled 'Year' and display the range 2007-2017. The y-axis should be labeled 'Annual Entry/Exit Totals (in millions)'.\n3. **Data Representation:** Plot five distinct lines, one for each of the top 5 stations. Include a clear legend that maps each line color to the corresponding station name.\n4. **Title:** Provide a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Annual Passenger Traffic for Top 5 Busiest London Underground Stations (2007-2017)'.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a white background for a clean, professional look.\n   - Select a harmonious and distinguishable color palette for the five lines.\n   - Use subtle, light-gray gridlines to aid readability without cluttering the view.\n   - Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels and legend text.\n   - Ensure there is no overlap between any chart elements."
