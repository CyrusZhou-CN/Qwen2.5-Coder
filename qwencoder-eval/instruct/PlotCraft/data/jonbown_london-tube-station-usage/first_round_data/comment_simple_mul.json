Follow these steps to create a compliant and high-quality visualization:\n1.  **Data Processing:** First, calculate the average annual usage for all London Underground stations from 2007 to 2017 to identify the top 5 busiest stations.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a single chart (1x1 layout) using a line chart type. Do not use subplots.\n3.  **Axes Configuration:**\n    *   Set the X-axis to represent 'Year', with ticks from 2007 to 2017.\n    *   Set the Y-axis to represent 'Annual Passenger Traffic (in millions)'.\n4.  **Plotting Data:** Plot five separate lines on the single chart, where each line represents the annual passenger traffic for one of the top 5 stations over the specified decade.\n5.  **Titles and Labels:**\n    *   Add a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Annual Passenger Traffic for Top 5 Busiest London Underground Stations (2007-2017)'.\n    *   Label the X-axis as 'Year' and the Y-axis as 'Passenger Traffic (Millions)'.\n6.  **Legend:** Include a legend that clearly associates each colored line with the corresponding station name.\n7.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a clean, white background for the chart.\n    *   Select a professional and harmonious color palette for the five lines, ensuring they are easily distinguishable.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy: the main title should be bold and larger than the axis titles, which should be larger than the tick labels.\n    *   If using gridlines, make them thin and light gray so they don't distract from the data lines."
