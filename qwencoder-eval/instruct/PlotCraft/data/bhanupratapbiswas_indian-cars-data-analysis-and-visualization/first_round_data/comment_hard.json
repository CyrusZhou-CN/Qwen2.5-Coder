    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, several critical changes are needed to align with the prompt and enhance quality:\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    -   **Subplot (1, 1):** Add the requested network graph overlay on top of the correlation heatmap to show connections between variables.\n    -   **Subplot (1, 2):** Replace the current scatter plot with a proper scatter plot matrix (pairplot) for Power vs. Torque, and add marginal histograms on the top and right axes.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 0):** Replace the horizontal bar chart with the requested treemap to show the hierarchical composition of Make > Body_Type > Fuel_Type. Use area to encode count and color intensity for average price.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 2):** Add the requested heatmap of technical specification values below the dendrogram, ensuring the columns align with the car models on the x-axis.\n    -   **Subplot (0, 2):** Change the bubble color to represent 'Make' (categorical) instead of 'Avg Price' (continuous) and add a corresponding legend.\n2.  **Layout and Overlap:**\n    -   **Main Title:** Significantly reduce the font size of the main title 'Comprehensive Indian Car Market Analysis...' and adjust its vertical position to eliminate the overlap with the subplot titles in the first row.\n    -   **Spacing:** Use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.set_constrained_layout(True)`) to ensure uniform and adequate spacing between all nine subplots.\n3.  **Text and Labeling:**\n    -   **Subplot (0, 2):** Implement a text repulsion algorithm (e.g., `adjustText`) for the bubble labels to prevent them from overlapping and ensure readability.\n    -   **Subplot (2, 1):** Add a label for the unlabeled top-right axis (presumably 'Power').\n4.  **Clutter and Readability:**\n    -   **Subplot (2, 1):** The radar chart is too cluttered. To improve it, either highlight the top 5-6 most common 'Body_Types' and display the rest in a muted gray, or group less common types into an 'Other' category. The legend is also excessively long and should be simplified or moved outside the plot area."
