    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is attempting to visualize too many categories, especially in the top subplot. Here are specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Rethink the Stacked Bar Chart (subplot (0, 0)):** The current approach of stacking by individual car model is not feasible with this many models. Instead, stack the bars by 'Body Type'. This would create a much clearer chart with a manageable number of colors/segments, allowing for a direct comparison of manufacturers' portfolio compositions (e.g., showing what percentage of Maruti Suzuki's cars are Hatchbacks vs. Sedans). This would also align its legend with the pie chart.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Pie Chart (subplot (1, 0)):** To eliminate unreadability, group the smallest categories. For instance, all body types with less than 2% market share could be consolidated into a single 'Other' slice. This would declutter both the chart and the legend.\n\n3.  **Fix Pie Chart Labeling:** To address the severe label overlap, use callout lines (leader lines) to position the labels for smaller slices away from the chart. Alternatively, remove the labels from the slices entirely and rely on a clean legend, but ensure the legend is concise (which grouping into 'Other' would achieve).\n\n4.  **Separate and Drastically Reduce Legends:** The single, massive legend is the biggest failure. Each subplot should have its own, relevant legend, or they should share one concise legend if the categories are harmonized (as suggested in point 1). The legend for individual 'Car Models' should be completely removed as it is ineffective.\n\n5.  **Improve Layout and Hierarchy:** Create a single main title for the entire figure (e.g., 'Market Composition of Indian Cars'). The current subplot titles can be converted to smaller subtitles. This improves the overall visual hierarchy. The space occupied by the current legend should be reclaimed to give the charts more prominence."
