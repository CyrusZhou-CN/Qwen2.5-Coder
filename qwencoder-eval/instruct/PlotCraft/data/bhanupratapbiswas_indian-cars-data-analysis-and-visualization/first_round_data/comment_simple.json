A complete recreation is necessary.\n\n1.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Discard the pie chart and scatter plot. Create a single horizontal bar chart in a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data Representation:** The y-axis should display the names of the top 10 car models. The x-axis should represent the 'Ex-Showroom Price'. The bars should be sorted in descending order, with the most expensive car model at the top.\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Top 10 Car Models by Ex-Showroom Price'. The title should be bolded and have a larger font size than the axis labels to create a proper visual hierarchy.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** Label the x-axis as 'Ex-Showroom Price (INR)'. The y-axis does not require a title, as the car model names serve as the labels.\n    *   **Tick Labels:** Ensure the price values on the x-axis are formatted for readability (e.g., '8 Cr', '10 Cr' or using scientific notation if the numbers are very large).\n4.  **Color and Formatting:**\n    *   **Color:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., steel blue or dark gray) for all bars to maintain a professional look. Avoid rainbow palettes.\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a white background for the chart. If gridlines are necessary, they should be light gray, thin, and run vertically to aid in reading the x-axis values without distracting from the data.\n    *   **Spines:** For a cleaner, publication-ready appearance, remove the top and right chart borders (spines)."
