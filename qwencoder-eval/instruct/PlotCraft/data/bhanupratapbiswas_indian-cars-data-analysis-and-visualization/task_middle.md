## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the market composition of Indian cars using a 2x1 subplot layout. In the top subplot, create a horizontal stacked bar chart displaying the distribution of car models across different manufacturers (Make), with each segment representing a different model and colored distinctly. In the bottom subplot, create a pie chart showing the percentage composition of cars by body type, with each slice labeled with both the body type name and its percentage. Use appropriate colors, legends, and titles for both plots to clearly communicate the market structure and dominance patterns in the Indian automotive sector.
