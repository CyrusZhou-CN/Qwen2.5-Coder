# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the distribution of different license types in Texas electrical contractors. Design a subplot with two complementary charts: (1) a horizontal bar chart displaying the count of each license type, and (2) a pie chart showing the percentage composition of license types. Ensure both charts are properly labeled with titles, and the pie chart includes percentage labels for each segment. Use consistent color schemes between the two charts to maintain visual coherence.
