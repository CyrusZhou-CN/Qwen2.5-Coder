## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the clustering and hierarchical relationships of licensed electricians in Texas. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Create a treemap showing license type composition overlaid with text annotations displaying exact counts and percentages for each license category; (2) Top-right: Generate a hierarchical dendrogram clustering analysis of license types based on their frequency patterns, combined with a horizontal bar chart showing the distribution of each license type; (3) Bottom-left: Construct a network graph visualization showing the relationships between different license types and their co-occurrence patterns, overlaid with a scatter plot where node sizes represent license frequency; (4) Bottom-right: Design a parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between license types and county distribution patterns, combined with a violin plot displaying the density distribution of licenses across different categories.
