    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several specific changes are needed:\n1.  **Overall Layout & Titles**: Remove the large, overlapping main title ('Complex Analysis...'). Instead, use a single, concise figure title (suptitle) placed cleanly above the entire 2x2 grid. Increase the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters to add more separation between the subplots, preventing any potential overlap of titles or labels.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Treemap**: For the smaller rectangles where text is unreadable, either remove the text annotations or use callout lines to place the labels in the surrounding white space. This will declutter the visualization and make the data for all categories accessible.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Dendrogram/Bar Chart**: Re-structure this plot for clarity. The dendrogram should be on the left, with the horizontal bar chart on the right, ensuring the bars align perfectly with the leaves of the dendrogram. This is the standard, intuitive way to present this combination. Crucially, reverse the x-axis so that it reads from 0 on the left to the maximum value on the right. Remove the redundant right-side y-axis and label the bottom x-axis as 'License Count'.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Network Graph**: First, correct the data representation to meet the prompt: the graph should show co-occurrence relationships between *license types*, not between licenses and counties. To fix the visual clutter, apply a more effective layout algorithm (e.g., Fruchterman-Reingold with adjusted repulsion) to spread the nodes out. Reduce node sizes by about 20% and use a text-repulsion library to automatically position labels to avoid overlap.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Parallel Coordinates**: Fulfill the prompt by replacing the ambiguous shaded areas with actual violin plots. Place a small violin plot vertically on each parallel axis (each county) to clearly show the density distribution of licenses at that location. Correct the truncated legend labels to display the full license type names. To improve balance, consider moving the legend to the bottom of the figure or integrating it more tightly with the plot."
