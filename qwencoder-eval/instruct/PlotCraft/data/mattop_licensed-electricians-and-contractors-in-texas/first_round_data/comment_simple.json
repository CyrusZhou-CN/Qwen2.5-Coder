    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is its unreadability due to the high number of small categories. A pie chart is generally not suitable for this type of data distribution. A horizontal bar chart would be a much better alternative. However, to improve the existing pie chart:\n\n1.  **Simplify Labeling:** Remove the category name labels (e.g., 'Electrical Contractor', 'Apprentice Sign Electrician') from the pie chart itself. The legend already provides this information, and their inclusion on the chart causes extreme clutter and overlap.\n2.  **Group Small Slices:** Combine all categories that are less than 1% into a single slice labeled \"Other\". This will drastically declutter the chart and make the main components more visible. A separate table or bar chart can be used to detail the contents of the \"Other\" category if necessary.\n3.  **Improve Readability of Percentages:** For the remaining small slices, consider using callout lines (leader lines) to place their percentage labels in the surrounding white space instead of directly on the tiny slices where they can be hard to read.\n4.  **Remove 3D Effect:** The shadow effect adds visual clutter and can slightly distort the perception of slice proportions. A flat, 2D pie chart is the professional standard for clarity and accuracy.\n5.  **Refine Legend:** The legend is very long. While functional, consider reducing the font size slightly or exploring a two-column layout for the legend to make it more compact and visually balanced with the chart."
