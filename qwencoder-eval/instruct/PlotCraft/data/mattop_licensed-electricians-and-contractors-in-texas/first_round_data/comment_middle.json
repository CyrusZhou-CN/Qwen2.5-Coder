    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure to meet the prompt's requirements and must be recreated from scratch. \n\n1.  **Adhere to the Task Prompt:** The primary goal is to follow the instructions. \n    *   **Layout:** Create a 1x2 or 2x1 layout containing only two subplots. \n    *   **Chart Types:** The first subplot must be a horizontal bar chart, and the second must be a pie chart. The third, unrelated line chart must be removed. \n    *   **Data and Text:** The data and all text elements (titles, axis labels, data labels) must be about 'Texas electrical contractors license types'. All current nonsensical text must be replaced with accurate and relevant information. For example, the main title should be 'Distribution of Texas Electrical Contractor License Types'.\n\n2.  **Improve Visual Quality:**\n    *   **Formatting:** Adopt a professional, publication-ready standard. Use a white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines. \n    *   **Color Scheme:** Replace the current clashing, neon colors with a single, professional color palette. Use these colors consistently across both the bar chart and the pie chart, so that each license type is represented by the same color in both visualizations. \n    *   **Text Hierarchy:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy. The main chart title should be larger and bold. Subplot titles should be distinct but smaller than the main title. \n    *   **Bar Chart:** The horizontal bar chart should have a clear y-axis listing the license types and an x-axis labeled 'Count' or 'Number of Licenses'. Consider sorting the bars from longest to shortest for easier comparison. \n    *   **Pie Chart:** Ensure the percentage labels are clearly legible. The labels for each slice should correspond to the license types shown in the bar chart."
