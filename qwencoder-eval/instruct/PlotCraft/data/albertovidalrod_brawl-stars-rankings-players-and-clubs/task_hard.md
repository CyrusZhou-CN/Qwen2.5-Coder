## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the clustering patterns and hierarchical relationships within the Brawl Stars competitive ecosystem. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Player Performance Clustering Analysis
- Subplot 1: Scatter plot with KDE contours showing the relationship between total trophies and highest trophies, with points colored by experience level and sized by 3vs3 victories
- Subplot 2: Violin plot overlaid with box plots comparing trophy distributions across different player name color categories, with individual data points as a swarm plot
- Subplot 3: Parallel coordinates plot showing the relationships between trophies, experience level, solo victories, duo victories, and 3vs3 victories for top players

Row 2: Club Ecosystem and Member Dynamics
- Subplot 4: Network-style scatter plot showing club trophies vs member count, with bubble sizes representing required trophies and colors indicating club type, overlaid with trend lines for each club type
- Subplot 5: Stacked bar chart showing club member role distributions (President, Vice President, Senior, Member) combined with a line plot overlay showing average member trophies per club
- Subplot 6: Hierarchical cluster heatmap showing the correlation matrix between club characteristics (trophies, member count, required trophies) and member performance metrics

Row 3: Brawler Performance Segmentation
- Subplot 7: Grouped violin plots comparing trophy distributions for different brawler power levels (9, 10, 11), overlaid with median lines and quartile markers
- Subplot 8: Multi-dimensional scatter plot matrix showing relationships between brawler rank, trophies, and highest trophies for selected high-performing brawlers, with regression lines
- Subplot 9: Dendrogram-style cluster analysis combined with a heatmap showing player performance patterns across different brawler categories (tank, support, damage dealer, etc.)

Each subplot should reveal distinct clustering patterns, hierarchical relationships, or natural groupings within the competitive Brawl Stars community structure.
