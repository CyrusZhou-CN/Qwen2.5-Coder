    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, the following changes are recommended:\n1.  **Layout Correction:** Change the layout from 1x2 to the specified 2x1 (two rows, one column).\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top Plot:**\n    *   **Chart Type:** Convert the vertical bar chart to a horizontal bar chart. The y-axis should list 'Club Names' and the x-axis should show 'Total Trophies'.\n    *   **Color Encoding:** Replace the solid bar colors with a sequential color gradient (e.g., 'viridis' or 'Blues') that maps to the 'Member Count'. Add a color bar to serve as a legend for this gradient.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom Plot:**\n    *   **Size Encoding:** Ensure the scatter plot points are sized inversely proportional to the club's rank (i.e., rank 1 is smallest). Add a legend to explain the relationship between point size and rank.\n4.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Titles:** Replace the current titles with a main figure title like 'Competitive Landscape of Brawl Stars Clubs' and specific subplot titles such as 'Top 15 Clubs by Total Trophies' and 'Relationship between Trophies and Member Count'.\n    *   **Legends:** Change the legend labels from 'Trendz' and 'Line of Confusion' to a consistent and descriptive label like 'Trend Line'.\n    *   **Text Correction:** Remove the annotation 'Glarbnok's Revenge' and correct the club name from '<c5>Just Us</c>' to 'Just Us'.\n5.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   **Style:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Adopt a cohesive and professional color palette. Use muted tones for the plots and a contrasting but non-clashing color (e.g., dark gray) for the trend lines.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the subplot titles and axis labels."
