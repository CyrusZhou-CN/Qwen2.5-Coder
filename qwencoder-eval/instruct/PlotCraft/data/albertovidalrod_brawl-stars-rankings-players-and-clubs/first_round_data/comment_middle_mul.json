    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements and professional standards.\n1.  **Layout:** Re-create the visualization using a 2x2 subplot grid as specified. Use `plt.subplots(2, 2)` and ensure consistent, balanced spacing between the plots using `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`.\n2.  **Chart Types:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the pie chart with a lollipop chart to rank players.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the scatter plot with a proper slope chart. This requires plotting points on two parallel y-axes (for 'Average Member Trophies' and 'Total Club Trophies') and connecting the corresponding points for each club with a line.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Add the missing dot plot to show the distribution for the top 50 players.\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   Replace all current titles and labels with descriptive, professional text. For example, subplot (0, 0) title should be 'Top 15 Clubs by Total Trophies', and its y-axis should be 'Club' and x-axis 'Total Trophies'.\n    *   Ensure every axis on every subplot is clearly and correctly labeled.\n    *   For subplot (1, 0), increase the font size of the data point labels and change their color from yellow to black or dark gray for readability.\n4.  **Color and Encoding:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Use a sequential color palette (e.g., a single-hue gradient from light blue to dark blue) for the bars to represent member count. Add a color bar legend.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Use a simple two-color scheme (e.g., blue for players with clubs, gray for those without) and add a legend.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Implement the specified encodings: dot size should be mapped to 'experience level' and dot color should be binary (e.g., orange for >100k trophies, gray for <=100k). Add clear legends for both size and color.\n5.  **Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n    *   Set the overall style to be professional. Use a white background for the figure and axes (`facecolor='white'`).\n    *   If using gridlines, make them subtle (light gray, thin, dashed).\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main figure title larger and bolder than the subplot titles, and subplot titles bolder than axis labels."
