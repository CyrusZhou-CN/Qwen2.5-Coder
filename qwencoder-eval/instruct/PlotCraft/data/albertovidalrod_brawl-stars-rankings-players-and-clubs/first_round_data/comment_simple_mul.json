    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data Sorting:** The most critical change is to re-sort the data in descending order of 'Trophy Count'. The club with the highest count should be at the top of the chart.\n2. **Color Gradient:** Invert the color gradient so that the highest trophy count corresponds to the darkest blue bar and the lowest count corresponds to the lightest blue bar. This aligns with standard data visualization conventions.\n3. **Y-Axis Label Cleaning:** Clean the data for the y-axis labels. The label '<c5>Just Us</c>' should be corrected to 'Just Us' by removing the HTML tags.\n4. **X-Axis Tick Formatting:** Format the x-axis tick labels to be more readable. Instead of scientific notation (e.g., '1.5e6'), use standard integers with commas (e.g., '1,500,000') or abbreviated forms like '1.5M'.\n5. **Typographic Hierarchy:** Emphasize the chart title by making it bold. This will create a stronger visual hierarchy and distinguish it from the axis labels.\n6. **Layout Adjustment:** Increase the right margin of the plot to provide more white space between the numerical labels on the bars and the edge of the chart, improving the overall layout balance."
