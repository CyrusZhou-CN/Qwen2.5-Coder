    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and requires a complete regeneration. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the current plot with a proper histogram to visualize the distribution of a single variable. \n2. **Data Mapping:** The x-axis should represent 'Trophy Count', and the y-axis should represent the frequency, 'Number of Players'. The current labels are swapped. \n3. **Text Content:** \n   - Set the main title to the required 'Distribution of Trophies Among Top 100 Global Players'. Remove all other titles and random text ('Banana Count Over Time', 'Top 100 Pickle Distribution', '78881+', etc.).\n   - Correct the axis labels: x-axis should be 'Trophy Count' and y-axis should be 'Number of Players'.\n4. **Mean Line and Legend:** \n   - Add a single vertical line representing the mean trophy count. \n   - The legend should clearly label this line, for example, 'Mean Trophy Count'. Remove the current nonsensical legend. \n5. **Aesthetics and Formatting:** \n   - Remove the large pink circle and any other extraneous elements. \n   - Use a professional and clean theme with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines. \n   - Choose a single, professional color for the histogram bars (e.g., a muted blue or gray). \n   - Ensure the title is bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy."
