    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the primary focus should be on adhering to the original task prompt by regenerating the correct chart types. For the existing visualization, the following cosmetic and formatting improvements are recommended:\n\n1.  **Layout and Sizing:**\n    *   Reduce the font size of the main title, 'Brawl Stars: Club Performance and Player Clustering Analysis', by approximately 40% to create better visual balance and eliminate the overlap with the subplot titles.\n\n2.  **Text Formatting and Clarity:**\n    *   Make all subplot titles bold to establish a clearer visual hierarchy.\n    *   In subplot (0,0), either change the y-axis label to 'Club Trophies (in Millions)' to match the tick labels (2.2, 2.1, etc.) or reformat the tick labels to display the full values (e.g., 2,200,000).\n    *   In subplot (0,1), change the color of the right y-axis label ('Avg Trophies per Member') and its corresponding ticks from red to black for a more professional and less distracting appearance.\n    *   In subplot (1,2), improve the x-axis of the dendrogram. Either add tick labels to identify the individual clusters/players or remove the ticks and the vague 'Player Clusters' label entirely if they do not convey specific information.\n\n3.  **Color Scheme:**\n    *   Implement a consistent color palette across all subplots for related categorical data. For instance, the colors representing experience levels in subplot (1,1) should be used consistently if that variable appears elsewhere.\n\n4.  **Chart-Specific Refinements:**\n    *   In subplot (0,2), add a legend for the bubble sizes to clarify what they represent (as per the prompt, this should be 'Total Club Trophies').\n    *   In subplot (0,1), reduce the width of the bars to create more visual separation between the categories on the x-axis."
