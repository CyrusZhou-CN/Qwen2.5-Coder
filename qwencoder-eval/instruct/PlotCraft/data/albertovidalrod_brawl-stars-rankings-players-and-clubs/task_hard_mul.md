## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing club performance patterns and player clustering in Brawl Stars. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Club Analysis):
1. Left: Combine a scatter plot of club trophies vs member count with a color-coded overlay showing badge types, plus marginal histograms showing the distribution of both variables
2. Middle: Create a dual-axis plot with stacked bars showing club membership distribution by trophy ranges, overlaid with a line plot showing average trophies per member across different club sizes
3. Right: Generate a bubble chart where bubble size represents total club trophies, x-axis shows member count, y-axis shows average member trophies (calculated from club info), with different colors for club types, plus a trend line

Bottom row (Player Clustering):
4. Left: Construct a scatter plot matrix (pair plot) showing relationships between player total trophies, highest trophies, experience level, and 3vs3 victories, with different colors for players based on their club membership status
5. Middle: Create a parallel coordinates plot overlaid with a violin plot showing the distribution of top 5 brawler trophy averages per player (calculate from individual brawler data), grouped by player experience level ranges
6. Right: Design a network-style cluster visualization showing player groupings based on similar trophy patterns across different brawlers, combined with a dendrogram showing hierarchical clustering of players by their brawler performance profiles

Use consistent color schemes across all subplots and ensure each composite chart effectively reveals clustering patterns, hierarchical relationships, and group formations within the Brawl Stars competitive ecosystem.
