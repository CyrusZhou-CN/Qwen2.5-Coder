Ranking

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the competitive landscape of Brawl Stars clubs. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot displays a horizontal bar chart of the top 15 clubs ranked by total trophies, with bars colored by member count using a color gradient. The bottom plot should show a scatter plot revealing the relationship between club trophies and member count, with point sizes proportional to the club's rank position (smaller points for better ranks). Add trend lines to both plots and ensure proper axis labels, legends, and a cohesive color scheme that highlights the ranking hierarchy.
