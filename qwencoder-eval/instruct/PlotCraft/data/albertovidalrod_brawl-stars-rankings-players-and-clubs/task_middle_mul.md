Ranking

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive ranking analysis dashboard using a 2x2 subplot grid. In the top-left, create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 15 clubs by total trophies with bars colored by member count (use a color gradient). In the top-right, create a lollipop chart displaying the top 15 individual players by trophies, with different colors for players who belong to clubs vs those without clubs. In the bottom-left, create a slope chart comparing each of the top 10 clubs' average member trophies vs their total club trophies (normalize both metrics to 0-100 scale for comparison). In the bottom-right, create a dot plot showing the distribution of trophy counts for the top 50 players, with dots sized by their experience level and colored by whether they have achieved over 100,000 total trophies. Add appropriate titles, labels, and legends for each subplot, and ensure consistent styling across all four visualizations.
