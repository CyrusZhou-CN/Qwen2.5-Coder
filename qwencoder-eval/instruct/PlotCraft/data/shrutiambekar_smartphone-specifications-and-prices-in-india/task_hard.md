## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing smartphone market segments and their characteristics. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Brand Analysis): 
- Subplot 1: Combine a horizontal bar chart showing average price by brand with overlaid scatter points showing individual model ratings
- Subplot 2: Create a bubble chart where x-axis is average RAM, y-axis is average battery capacity, bubble size represents number of models, and color represents brand category
- Subplot 3: Display a stacked bar chart of processor types by brand with an overlaid line plot showing average ratings

Middle row (Performance Segments):
- Subplot 4: Combine a violin plot of price distribution by RAM categories with overlaid box plots showing quartile information
- Subplot 5: Create a scatter plot of battery capacity vs camera megapixels with different colors for RAM tiers, including trend lines for each RAM category
- Subplot 6: Display a grouped bar chart of average specifications (normalized) by price segments with error bars showing standard deviation

Bottom row (Feature Relationships):
- Subplot 7: Combine a correlation heatmap of numerical features with marginal histograms showing distribution of each feature
- Subplot 8: Create a parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between price, rating, RAM, battery, and display size, with lines colored by brand tier
- Subplot 9: Display a cluster analysis visualization combining a dendrogram with a 2D scatter plot of phones positioned by their first two principal components, colored by identified clusters
