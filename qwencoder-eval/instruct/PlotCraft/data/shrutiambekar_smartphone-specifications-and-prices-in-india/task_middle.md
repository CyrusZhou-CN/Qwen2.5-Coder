Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between smartphone specifications and pricing. First, create a scatter plot showing the correlation between RAM capacity (extracted from the 'ram' column) and price (converted from rupees to numeric values), with points colored by rating scores. Then, overlay a regression line to show the trend. Additionally, create a secondary y-axis on the same plot to display the distribution of battery capacity (extracted from 'battery' column) using a histogram with transparency, allowing viewers to see how battery specifications relate to the price-RAM relationship.
