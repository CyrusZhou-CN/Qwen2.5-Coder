    "improvement_suggestions": "The entire visualization is incorrect for the task and needs to be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Discard both the pie chart and the scatter plot. Create a single plot (1x1 layout) using a histogram to show the distribution of ratings.\n2. **Axes Configuration:** The x-axis should represent 'Rating' and the y-axis should represent 'Frequency' (the count of smartphones in each rating bin).\n3. **Mean Line and Annotation:** Add a *vertical* line (`axvline`) on the histogram to indicate the mean rating. The current horizontal line is incorrect. Annotate this vertical line clearly with its value (e.g., 'Mean: 509.5').\n4. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - **Background and Colors:** Switch to a standard white background. Use a single, neutral color (e.g., steelblue or darkgray) for the histogram bars. Make the mean line a distinct, contrasting color like red or black.\n   - **Titles and Labels:** Replace the current titles with a single, descriptive title such as 'Distribution of Smartphone Ratings'. Ensure the title is bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy. Use black or dark gray for all text (titles, axis labels, tick labels) for maximum readability.\n   - **Remove Clutter:** Eliminate the unprofessional subtitle ('Glarblok's Revenge Data Visualization').\n5. **Binning:** Experiment with the number of bins in the histogram to find a value that clearly reveals the underlying shape of the data distribution without being too noisy or too coarse."
