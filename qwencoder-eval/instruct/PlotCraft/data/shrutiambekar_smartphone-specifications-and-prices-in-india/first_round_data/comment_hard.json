    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements. Here are specific suggestions:\n1.  **Fix Empty/Incomplete Plots:** The primary issue is the failure to generate most charts. The code must be debugged to correctly produce the visualizations for subplots (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n2.  **Subplot (0,0) - Brand Price vs Rating:** Change the overlaid red bubbles to a proper scatter plot showing *individual* model ratings, as requested. Relocate the 'Average Rating' axis from the top to the right side as a standard secondary y-axis for better clarity.\n3.  **Subplot (0,1) - RAM vs Battery:** Correct the data scaling on both the x and y axes to reflect realistic values for RAM (in GB) and Battery (in mAh). Move the legend outside the plot area to the right to prevent it from overlapping with the data bubbles (e.g., using `ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1))`).\n4.  **Subplot (0,2) - Processor Types:** Significantly reduce the `markersize` of the 'Avg Rating' line plot so the markers do not obscure the stacked bars underneath.\n5.  **Subplot (2,0) - Feature Correlation:** Implement the marginal histograms on the top and right sides of the heatmap. Adjust the plot's layout or figure padding to ensure the y-axis tick labels are fully visible and not truncated.\n6.  **Layout and Titles:** Add a main title (suptitle) to the entire 3x3 figure to provide overall context, for example, 'Smartphone Market Segment Analysis'. Use `plt.tight_layout()` or `constrained_layout=True` to improve spacing and prevent titles and labels from overlapping between subplots.\n7.  **Aesthetic Cohesion:** Establish a consistent and professional color palette to be used across all subplots to create a more unified and visually appealing dashboard."
