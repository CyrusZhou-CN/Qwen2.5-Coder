    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul due to fundamental data plotting errors. \n1. **Correct X-Axis Data and Scaling:** The most critical issue is the x-axis. The 'RAM Capacity' data must be parsed correctly and plotted on a scale appropriate for smartphones (e.g., 0 to 20 GB), not 0 to 22,000. This will correctly distribute the scatter plot points and make the visualization meaningful.\n2. **Re-implement the Histogram:** The current implementation of the histogram is incorrect. The task of overlaying a histogram of one variable (battery) onto a scatter plot of two other variables (RAM vs. Price) is conceptually flawed. A better approach would be to create a 2x1 layout: the top plot showing the RAM vs. Price scatter plot, and the bottom plot showing a proper histogram of Battery Capacity with its own correctly labeled x-axis representing battery capacity bins (e.g., 3000-4000 mAh, 4000-5000 mAh, etc.).\n3. **Improve Element Placement and Formatting:** Once the main plots are corrected, reposition the legends and text boxes to avoid overlap. Place them in a clear area, such as the top-right corner. For a more professional look, remove the background colors and shadows from the legends and text box, using only a thin border if needed.\n4. **Enhance Text Consistency:** Ensure all axis labels ('Price (₹)', 'RAM Capacity (GB)', 'Frequency') have a consistent font weight (e.g., all bold). The main title should be bold and slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n5. **Update Regression Line:** After correcting the x-axis scaling, the regression line and its corresponding R² value must be recalculated and replotted, as they will change significantly."
