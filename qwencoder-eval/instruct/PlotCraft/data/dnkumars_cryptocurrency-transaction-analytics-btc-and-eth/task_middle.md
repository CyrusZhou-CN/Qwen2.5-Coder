## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization analyzing the relationship between transaction amounts and fees across different cryptocurrencies and mining pools. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a scatter plot of Amount vs Transaction_Fee with points colored by Currency (BTC/ETH) and sized by Gas_Price_Gwei (where applicable), and the bottom plot displays a correlation heatmap showing the correlation coefficients between Amount, Transaction_Fee, and Gas_Price_Gwei for each currency separately. Include trend lines in the scatter plot and ensure proper handling of missing Gas_Price_Gwei values for BTC transactions.
