    "improvement_suggestions": "To align the chart with the prompt and improve its quality, the following changes are necessary:\n1.  **Layout Correction**: The entire visualization must be restructured into a 2x1 layout. The scatter plot should be the top subplot (0, 0), and the correlation heatmap(s) should be in the bottom subplot (1, 0).\n2.  **Text Content Correction**: All text must be replaced with accurate labels. \n    -   For subplot (0, 0): Set the title to 'Transaction Amount vs. Fee by Currency', the x-axis to 'Amount', the y-axis to 'Transaction_Fee', and the legend labels to 'BTC' and 'ETH'.\n    -   For the bottom section (1, 0): This should contain two separate heatmaps, titled 'BTC Correlation Matrix' and 'ETH Correlation Matrix'. The axes for both should be labeled 'Amount', 'Transaction_Fee', and 'Gas_Price_Gwei'.\n3.  **Visualization Logic**: \n    -   In the scatter plot (0, 0), replace the single horizontal line with two distinct and correctly calculated trend lines, one for BTC and one for ETH.\n    -   The bottom plot (1, 0) needs to be completely regenerated to show two 3x3 correlation matrices for the specified variables, one for each currency.\n4.  **Color and Formatting**: \n    -   Adopt a professional color palette. For the scatter plot, use a higher-contrast color pair like blue and orange. \n    -   For the heatmaps, use a standard diverging color palette (e.g., blue-white-red) to represent negative, zero, and positive correlations, respectively. Avoid the current neon colors.\n    -   Change the background of both plots to white. Make gridlines light gray and thin. \n    -   Reduce the line width of the cell borders in the heatmap for a cleaner look.\n    -   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making titles bold and slightly larger than axis labels."
