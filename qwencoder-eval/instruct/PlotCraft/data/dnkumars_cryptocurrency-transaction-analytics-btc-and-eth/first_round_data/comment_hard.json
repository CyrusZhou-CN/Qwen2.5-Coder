    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n   - **X-Axes:** The most critical fix is to correct the x-axes for subplots (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 1). They must be formatted to show dates or time periods (e.g., 'Week 1', 'Week 2') as specified in the prompt, not numeric indices.\n   - **Legends:** Add the missing legends. In subplot (2, 0), add a legend entry for the red 'Total Volume' line. In subplot (2, 2), add a legend or annotation to explain that the blue contour lines represent 'Average Transaction Value'.\n   - **Legend Correction:** Revise the legend in subplot (0, 2). It should have four distinct entries: 'BTC Frequency', 'ETH Frequency', 'BTC Avg Size', and 'ETH Avg Size'.\n\n2. **Visualization & Clarity Improvements:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** The scatter points are crushed at the bottom. To fix this, consider plotting the cumulative area on the left y-axis and the individual transaction scatter points on a secondary right y-axis to handle the scale difference. Also, for the area charts, use a stacked area plot to avoid the color-blending issue from overlapping transparent layers.\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** The scatter plot is unreadable due to overplotting. Replace it with a 2D density plot (heatmap) or a hexbin plot to visualize the concentration of points. Alternatively, drastically reduce the marker size and set a low alpha value (e.g., `alpha=0.05`) to reveal the underlying distribution.\n   - **Subplot (2, 2):** To fix the overlapping x-axis labels, either reduce the number of ticks to show fewer dates (e.g., one label per week) or decrease the font size and adjust the rotation angle.\n\n3. **Layout & Formatting:**\n   - **Spacing:** Increase the overall spacing to improve readability and visual appeal. Use a function like `fig.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)` to add more vertical and horizontal space between the subplots.\n   - **Professional Polish:** For a cleaner look, remove the top and right spines (borders) from each subplot, especially those without a secondary axis. This is a common practice in publication-quality charts."
