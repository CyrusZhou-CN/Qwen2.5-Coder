    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the two pie charts with a single histogram. The x-axis should represent the 'Transaction Amount' and the y-axis should represent 'Frequency' or 'Number of Transactions'.\n2. **Data Representation:** Plot the distributions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the same set of axes. Use different colors for the bars of each cryptocurrency. To handle overlapping bins, set the bar opacity (alpha) to a value like 0.6 to ensure both distributions are visible.\n3. **Title and Labels:** Change the main title to something informative, such as 'Distribution of BTC and ETH Transaction Amounts'. The x-axis label should be 'Transaction Amount (e.g., in USD)' and the y-axis label should be 'Frequency'. Remove all current nonsensical text.\n4. **Legend:** Add a legend to the chart to clearly identify which color corresponds to Bitcoin (BTC) and which corresponds to Ethereum (ETH).\n5. **Color Scheme:** Discard the current rainbow palettes. Use a professional and simple color scheme with two distinct, non-clashing colors (e.g., a standard blue for BTC and a standard orange for ETH).\n6. **Layout:** Use a single 1x1 plot layout. Ensure there is sufficient white space around the chart elements (title, axes, legend) to avoid any overlap and improve readability."
