    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires extensive revisions to meet the prompt's requirements and improve quality. \n1. **Correct Chart Implementations**: The highest priority is to fix the incorrect chart types and data encodings. \n   - **Subplot (1,0)**: Add the missing line plot showing the average transaction amount per city. \n   - **Subplot (1,1)**: Rebuild as a 10x10 grid and add patterns/borders to squares to encode city information, including a legend. \n   - **Subplot (1,2)**: Recreate as a two-level sunburst chart (inner: cities, outer: card types). \n   - **Subplot (2,0)**: Change from a line chart to a stacked area chart and add markers for individual transactions. \n   - **Subplot (2,1)**: Correctly map bubble size to spending amount and bubble color to transaction count. Add legends for both size and color. Reduce the overall size of the bubbles to create space between them. \n   - **Subplot (2,2)**: Re-encode line color by spending range and line thickness by transaction frequency. Replace the numerical y-axis ticks with the actual categorical labels for 'City' and 'Card Type'.\n2. **Element Positioning and Spacing**: \n   - **Subplot (0,1)**: Reposition the percentage labels to eliminate overlap, potentially using callout lines. \n   - **Subplot (0,2)**: Expand the treemap to fill the entire subplot area. \n   - **Subplot (1,2)**: Enlarge the sunburst chart to better utilize its subplot space.\n3. **Color Scheme Enhancements**: \n   - Maintain a consistent color palette for card types across all subplots. Remove the inconsistent colors in subplot (0,1). \n   - Apply a meaningful color gradient (e.g., sequential) to the bubble chart (2,1) and treemap (0,2) to represent transaction counts/frequency, and add a color bar legend.\n4. **Text Formatting Improvements**: \n   - In subplots (0,0) and (2,1), consider abbreviating city names or using a horizontal bar chart format to avoid rotated labels. \n   - Ensure all plots have clear, descriptive titles and necessary legends."
