    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign to be effective. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Layout and Content:**\n    *   Remove the unrequested and illegible bottom-left plot ('Average Amount (INR) vs Cities').\n    *   Adopt a clean 1x2 grid layout. Place the scatter plot on the left and the box plot on the right.\n    *   Ensure the y-axes of both plots are aligned and share the same scale for direct comparison of distributions.\n\n2.  **Fix the Unreadable X-Axis:**\n    *   The number of cities is too large to display as individual labels. Instead of plotting all cities, consider one of these alternatives:\n        *   Plot only the top 10-15 cities by total or average spending.\n        *   Group cities by region or state and plot the aggregated data.\n        *   If showing the overall spread is the goal, remove the x-axis tick labels entirely and explain in the title that the plot shows data across all cities.\n\n3.  **Improve Scatter Plot Readability:**\n    *   The points are too dense. Introduce transparency (an alpha value of ~0.3-0.5) to the scatter points to reveal areas of high density.\n    *   Increase the jitter effect on the x-axis to spread the points out more clearly within each category.\n    *   The 'size proportional to amount' feature is not visually effective. Consider using a logarithmic scale for sizing if amounts have a wide range, or remove this encoding if it adds more clutter than insight.\n\n4.  **Enhance Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Change the background of all plots to white.\n    *   Use subtle, light gray gridlines for the y-axis only to guide the eye without distracting from the data.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy for text. The main figure title should be prominent (e.g., bold, size 16), subplot titles smaller (e.g., bold, size 12), and axis labels smaller still (e.g., regular, size 10).\n\n5.  **Organize Annotations:**\n    *   Move the statistical summary text box to a clear space, for instance, below the two main plots, spanning the width of the figure.\n    *   Position the correlation coefficient annotations (e.g., 'Gold: r=-0.052') neatly outside the plot area of the scatter plot to avoid covering any data points."
