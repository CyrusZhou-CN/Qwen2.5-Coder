Here are the steps to create a compliant and high-quality chart:\n1. **Chart Type:** Create a single histogram, not a bar chart or a pie chart.\n2. **Data Representation:** The x-axis must represent the continuous variable 'Transaction Amount', and the y-axis must represent the frequency or count of transactions.\n3. **Bins:** The data on the x-axis should be grouped into 15 bins as requested.\n4. **Labels and Title:**\n   - **Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title, such as 'Distribution of Credit Card Transaction Amounts in India'.\n   - **X-axis Label:** Label it 'Transaction Amount'.\n   - **Y-axis Label:** Label it 'Number of Transactions' or 'Frequency'.\n5. **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n   - Use a standard white background for the chart.\n   - Choose a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue or grey) for the histogram bars.\n   - Ensure all text is legible and correctly spelled.\n   - Use a clean layout with adequate spacing around all elements to avoid clutter."
