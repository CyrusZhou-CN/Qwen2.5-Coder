# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between spending amounts and card types across different cities. Design a scatter plot with Amount on the y-axis and cities on the x-axis (using jitter for better visibility), where points are colored by Card Type and sized proportionally to the spending amount. Overlay this with box plots showing the distribution of spending amounts for each Card Type, positioned as a secondary subplot or marginal plot. Include trend lines or statistical annotations to highlight correlations between card types and spending patterns across cities.
