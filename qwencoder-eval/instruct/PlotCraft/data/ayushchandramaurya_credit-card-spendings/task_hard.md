# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the composition and distribution patterns of credit card spending in India. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (1,1): Create a stacked bar chart showing total spending amount by city, with each bar segment representing different card types, overlaid with scatter points indicating the number of transactions per city-card type combination.

Top row (1,2): Design a pie chart showing the overall composition of spending by card type, with an inner donut chart displaying the distribution of cities, and add percentage labels for both layers.

Top row (1,3): Build a treemap visualization showing hierarchical spending composition (City > Card Type > Amount), with rectangle sizes proportional to spending amounts and color intensity representing transaction frequency.

Middle row (2,1): Construct a horizontal stacked bar chart displaying spending distribution across cities, with each segment colored by card type, and overlay a line plot showing the average transaction amount per city.

Middle row (2,2): Create a waffle chart (10x10 grid) where each square represents a percentage of total spending, colored by card type, with city information encoded through different square patterns or borders.

Middle row (2,3): Design a sunburst chart showing the hierarchical relationship between cities (inner ring) and card types (outer ring), with segment sizes proportional to total spending amounts.

Bottom row (3,1): Build a stacked area chart showing cumulative spending over time (sorted by date), with different areas representing different card types, overlaid with markers indicating individual transaction amounts.

Bottom row (3,2): Create a bubble chart where x-axis represents cities, y-axis represents card types, bubble sizes indicate total spending amounts, and bubble colors show the number of transactions.

Bottom row (3,3): Construct a parallel coordinates plot connecting City, Card Type, and Amount variables, with lines colored by spending ranges (low, medium, high) and line thickness representing transaction frequency.
