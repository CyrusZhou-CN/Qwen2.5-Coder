    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally flawed as it contains no data. The primary improvement is to actually plot the histogram.\n1.  **Plot the Histogram:** Generate a histogram from the 'budget' data column and display it within the plot area.\n2.  **Correct the Y-Axis:** The y-axis must be corrected. Since the label is 'Number of Respondents', the axis should display integer counts (e.g., 0, 5, 10, 15...). The current float-based scale is incorrect and should be replaced.\n3.  **Adjust Axis Limits:** The x and y-axis limits should be adjusted to fit the data appropriately once the histogram is plotted, ensuring there isn't excessive white space.\n4.  **Improve Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title 'Distribution of Home Renovation Budgets' bold to distinguish it from the axis labels and create a stronger visual hierarchy.\n5.  **Choose Appropriate Bins:** When plotting the histogram, select a number of bins that effectively illustrates the shape of the budget distribution."
