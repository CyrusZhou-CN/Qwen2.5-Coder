    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Fix Generation Errors:** The primary priority is to resolve the errors preventing subplots (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) from rendering. They must be replaced with the specified charts.\n2. **Implement Correct Chart Types and Components:**\n   - **Subplot (0, 0):** Must be a stacked bar chart with an overlaid line plot.\n   - **Subplot (0, 1):** Add the required error bars to the grouped bars.\n   - **Subplot (0, 2):** Add the scatter point overlay. Adjust the plot area or font size to prevent radial labels from being truncated (e.g., 'Le... costly ene...').\n   - **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the pie chart with the requested treemap with embedded pie charts.\n   - **Subplot (1, 2):** Convert the scatter plot into a network plot by adding edges (lines) to represent the interconnections.\n   - **Subplot (2, 0):** Add the specified heatmap next to the dendrogram to show clustering patterns.\n   - **Subplot (2, 1):** Re-structure the plot. The x-axis should represent the categorical variables ('energy material usage levels' and 'renovation experience'), not the continuous variable being measured. The y-axis should show the distribution of 'willingness to pay'.\n3. **Improve Text Readability:** For subplots (0, 1) and (2, 1), avoid rotating x-axis labels. Instead, use horizontal labels and increase the vertical spacing between subplots (`hspace`) to prevent them from clashing with the plot above.\n4. **Create a Unified Visual Theme:** Adopt a consistent and professional color palette across all nine subplots to visually link related categories and create a cohesive dashboard aesthetic.\n5. **Refine Layout and Spacing:** After implementing the correct charts, use a function like `plt.tight_layout()` with padding to ensure all elements, including titles, axis labels, and legends, are fully visible and do not overlap."
