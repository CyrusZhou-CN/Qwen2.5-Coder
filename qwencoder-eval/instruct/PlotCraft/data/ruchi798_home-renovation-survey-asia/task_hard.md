## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing customer segmentation patterns in the home renovation survey data. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Stacked bar chart with overlaid line plot showing renovation budget distribution across house types with average willingness to pay premium percentages, (2) Top-middle: Grouped bar chart with error bars displaying energy-efficient solution adoption rates by neighborhood type and family size, (3) Top-right: Radar chart overlaid with scatter points comparing renovation motivations across different consultation preferences, (4) Middle-left: Treemap with embedded pie charts showing room renovation preferences segmented by renovation frequency patterns, (5) Middle-center: Parallel coordinates plot with density curves showing the relationship between budget, energy material usage, house type, and energy efficiency knowledge, (6) Middle-right: Network-style cluster plot with bubble sizes representing the interconnections between renovation drivers, app feature preferences, and marketing channel effectiveness, (7) Bottom-left: Hierarchical dendrogram combined with heatmap showing clustering patterns of respondents based on their energy efficiency attitudes and demographic characteristics, (8) Bottom-middle: Violin plots with box plot overlays displaying the distribution of consultation service willingness to pay across different energy material usage levels and renovation experience, (9) Bottom-right: Sankey-style flow diagram with grouped bar chart showing the customer journey from renovation motivation through consultation preferences to final budget allocation and energy efficiency adoption.
