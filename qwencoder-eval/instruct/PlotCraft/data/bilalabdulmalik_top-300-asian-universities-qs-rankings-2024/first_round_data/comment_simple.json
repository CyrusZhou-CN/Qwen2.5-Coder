    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Fundamental Change:** Discard all three current plots. Create a single horizontal bar chart. \n2. **Data Representation:** The y-axis should list the names of the top 15 Asian universities. The x-axis should represent the 'Overall Score'. Each university should have a corresponding horizontal bar whose length represents its score. \n3. **Sorting:** The bars must be sorted in descending order, with the university having the highest score positioned at the top of the chart. \n4. **Text Elements:** The chart needs a correct and descriptive title, such as 'Top 15 Asian Universities by Overall Score'. The x-axis should be labeled 'Overall Score' and the y-axis 'University'. Ensure all university names on the y-axis are fully visible and not truncated. \n5. **Professional Formatting:** Adopt a clean, publication-ready style. Use a white background, remove the heavy chart borders (spines), and use subtle, light-gray gridlines only on the x-axis if needed. The main title should be bold and larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy. \n6. **Color Scheme:** Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a medium blue or gray) for all bars to maintain a professional look. Avoid using multiple colors unless there is a specific categorical reason, and absolutely avoid rainbow palettes."
