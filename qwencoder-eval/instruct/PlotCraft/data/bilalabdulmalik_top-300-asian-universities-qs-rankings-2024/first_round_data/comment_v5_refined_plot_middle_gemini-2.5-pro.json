    "improvement_suggestions": "To fully comply with the task, the primary change would be to merge the two plots into one: use the scatter plot as the base, add a secondary y-axis on the right for 'International Faculty %', and plot the country-level averages as a line plot on this secondary axis. However, a line plot may not be the best choice for unordered categorical data like countries. A better approach, while still improving the current chart, would be:\n\n1.  **Layout Refinement:** Convert the bottom bar chart into a horizontal bar chart. This would provide ample space for the country names on the y-axis, eliminating the current crowding and overlap issue and dramatically improving readability.\n2.  **Text and Element Positioning:** Relocate the text box in the scatter plot (subplot (0, 0)) to the top-left corner where there is more empty space, ensuring it does not obscure any data points.\n3.  **Legend Optimization:** The legend is very long. Consider placing it horizontally below both charts, arranged in 3-4 columns, to create a more balanced layout. Alternatively, reduce the font size of the legend text slightly.\n4.  **Color Scheme Enhancement:** Re-evaluate the color palette for the scatter plot. Use a color palette designed for a high number of categorical variables (e.g., from `colorbrewer2` or `matplotlib.cm.tab20`) to ensure each country is more clearly distinguishable.\n5.  **Data Sorting Consistency:** For better coherence between the two plots, sort the countries in the legend of the scatter plot to match the order in the bar chart (which is sorted by value, descending). This makes it easier for the viewer to cross-reference information."
