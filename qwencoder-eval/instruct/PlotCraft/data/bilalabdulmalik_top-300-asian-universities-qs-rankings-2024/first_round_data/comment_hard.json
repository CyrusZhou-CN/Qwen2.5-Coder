    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart, the following specific improvements are recommended:\n\n1.  **Layout and Spacing**: Adjust the grid layout to ensure consistent and minimal spacing between all subplots, both horizontally and vertically. The large vertical gaps between rows should be eliminated to create a cohesive and balanced dashboard. Standardize the aspect ratio of the subplots for a more uniform appearance.\n\n2.  **Compliance Corrections**:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0)**: Re-implement the chart as a joint plot to include the required marginal histograms on the top and right axes.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1)**: Add the hierarchical clustering dendrograms to the top and left (or right) of the heatmap to visualize the clustering of metrics.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0)**: Replace the current bar chart with a proper treemap. The treemap should visualize the specified country-city hierarchy. Cell colors should map to the 'Average Overall Score' using a continuous color scale, and a color bar legend must be included.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1)**: Update the network graph by scaling node sizes to represent university counts and encoding edge weights (similarity scores) through varying edge thickness or opacity.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 2)**: Overlay shaded areas or contour lines to represent the cluster boundaries. Correct the legend to fully explain the marker shapes for all ranking tiers (1-20, 21-50, 51-100).\n\n3.  **Legends and Text**: \n    *   Create a single, global legend for the country-color mapping and place it to the right of the 3x3 grid to avoid redundancy and improve clarity.\n    *   In the network graph (2, 1), replace the three-letter abbreviations with full country names to avoid ambiguity.\n    *   Add a legend to the parallel coordinates plot (1, 2) to identify the countries.\n\n4.  **Color Enhancements**:\n    *   For the parallel coordinates plot (1, 2), use a color palette with higher saturation and better contrast to make the individual country lines clearly distinguishable."
