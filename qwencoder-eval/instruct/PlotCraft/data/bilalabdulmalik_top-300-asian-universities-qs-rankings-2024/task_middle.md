## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between research excellence and international engagement in Asian universities. Design a scatter plot with Academic Reputation on the x-axis and Citations per Paper on the y-axis, where each point represents a university and is colored by country. Overlay this with a secondary y-axis showing International Faculty percentage as a line plot grouped by country (showing the average International Faculty percentage for each country). Add point sizes proportional to Overall Score to reveal how top-performing universities balance academic reputation, research impact, and international faculty diversity.
