## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing university performance clusters and regional patterns across Asian countries. Each subplot should be a composite visualization: (1) Top-left: Scatter plot with Academic Reputation vs Employer Reputation, overlaid with country-based color coding and bubble sizes representing Overall Score, plus marginal histograms showing distribution of each metric; (2) Top-center: Stacked bar chart showing count of universities by country, overlaid with a line plot showing average Overall Score per country; (3) Top-right: Box plot showing Citations per Paper distribution by country, overlaid with violin plots to show density distributions; (4) Middle-left: Radar chart comparing average performance metrics (Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, International Students, International Faculty, Faculty Student Ratio) for top 5 countries by university count; (5) Middle-center: Heatmap showing correlation matrix of all numerical performance metrics, overlaid with hierarchical clustering dendrogram; (6) Middle-right: Parallel coordinates plot showing performance profiles of top 20 universities across key metrics (Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, Citations per Paper, International Students), with lines colored by country; (7) Bottom-left: Treemap showing university count by country and city hierarchy, with cell sizes representing total universities and colors representing average Overall Score; (8) Bottom-center: Network graph showing country relationships based on similarity in performance metrics, with node sizes representing university count and edge weights representing similarity scores; (9) Bottom-right: Cluster scatter plot using PCA on all performance metrics, with points colored by country and shaped by ranking tiers (1-20, 21-50, 51-100), overlaid with cluster boundaries and centroids.
