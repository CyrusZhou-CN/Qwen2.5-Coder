    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several critical changes are needed:\n1.  **Overall Layout:** Use a layout adjustment function (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`) to create proper spacing between all subplots and prevent the main title from overlapping with subplot titles. Consider increasing the overall figure size.\n2.  **Subplot (1,1) - Dendrogram:** The x-axis tick labels are unreadable and should be removed as they represent arbitrary indices. Most importantly, implement the required color-coding for flair categories at the leaf nodes to make the clustering interpretable.\n3.  **Subplot (2,0) - Heatmap:** This plot is incomplete. Add the required marginal distribution plots along the top (for Comment Count) and right (for Score) axes to show the distribution of each variable independently. This can be achieved using `GridSpec` or a library function like `seaborn.jointplot`.\n4.  **Subplot (2,1) - Network Graph:** This subplot is entirely incorrect and must be completely redone. Replace the current graphic with a proper network graph. Nodes should represent authors, edges should connect authors with similar posting patterns, node size should be scaled by the author's total score, and nodes should be colored based on community detection clustering.\n5.  **Subplot (2,2) - Grouped Bar:** The 'Cumulative %' line is incorrect. Recalculate and plot the actual cumulative percentage across the flair categories. The line should rise from left to right, not be a flat line at 100%. Rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees to prevent them from overlapping.\n6.  **Text Formatting:** Reduce the font size of the main figure title to create a better visual hierarchy. For subplot (0,1), rotate the x-axis tick labels to make them legible."
