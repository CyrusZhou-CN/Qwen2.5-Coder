# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that ranks Reddit posts in the r/datascience subreddit by engagement metrics. Design a horizontal bar chart showing the top 15 posts ranked by their Score (upvotes), and overlay it with a secondary axis line plot showing the Comment Count for the same posts. Use different colors to distinguish between post Types (Top, New, Hot) in the bar chart, and ensure the post titles are truncated to 50 characters for readability. Add appropriate labels, legend, and title to clearly communicate which posts generate the highest engagement through both upvotes and comments.
