## Instruction
Create a comprehensive time series analysis visualization showing how cryptocurrency market microstructure evolves over time. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Line chart of midpoint prices for all three cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA) overlaid with their respective bid-ask spreads as filled areas, (2) Top-right: Stacked area chart showing the cumulative trading volume (buys + sells) for each cryptocurrency over time, (3) Bottom-left: Multi-line plot displaying the distance of the first bid and ask levels from midpoint for each cryptocurrency, with error bands showing volatility, (4) Bottom-right: Heatmap-style visualization showing the correlation matrix between the three cryptocurrencies' price movements over different time windows, with correlation values evolving as a time series. Use the 1-minute frequency data to capture meaningful market dynamics while ensuring all subplots share synchronized time axes.
