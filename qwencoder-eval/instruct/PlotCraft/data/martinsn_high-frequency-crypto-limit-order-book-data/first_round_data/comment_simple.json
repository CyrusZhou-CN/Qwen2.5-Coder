    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul as it fails to meet any of the user's requirements. \n1. **Start Over:** Discard the current two-plot layout. Create a single (1x1) plot.\n2. **Correct Chart Type:** Use a line chart (`plt.plot()`) instead of a scatter plot to connect the data points and show the trend over time.\n3. **Fix Axes:** Swap the axes. The x-axis must be `system_time` and the y-axis must be the `midpoint` price.\n4. **Correct Labels and Title:**\n   - Set the main title to something informative, such as 'Bitcoin (BTC) Midpoint Price Evolution'.\n   - Label the x-axis 'Time'.\n   - Label the y-axis 'Midpoint Price'.\n5. **Format Time Axis:** Convert the numerical `system_time` values on the x-axis into a readable date/time format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').\n6. **Remove Irrelevant Elements:** The top circular chart ('Delicious Pizza Slices') and the text annotation ('Glarbnok's Revenge') must be removed entirely.\n7. **Improve Aesthetics for Professionalism:**\n   - Use a standard, less jarring color for the line, like blue or black.\n   - Use a white background for the chart area.\n   - Make the gridlines subtle (light gray, thin lines) so they don't dominate the data.\n   - Ensure the title is bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
