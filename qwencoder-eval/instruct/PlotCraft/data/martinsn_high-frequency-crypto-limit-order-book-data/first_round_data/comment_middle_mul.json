    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and cannot be salvaged with minor adjustments. A complete regeneration is required. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid as specified in the prompt.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0):** Replace the pie chart with a line chart showing midpoint price evolution for BTC, ETH, and ADA. Overlay this with a scatter plot to mark significant spread changes. Use a clear legend and title.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1):** Replace the stacked bar chart with a stacked area chart for cumulative buy and sell volumes. Implement a secondary y-axis to plot the bid-ask spread as a line chart. Clearly label both y-axes.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0):** Replace the scatter plot with a multi-line chart comparing the bid distance from the midpoint for the three cryptocurrencies. Add semi-transparent error bands to represent the standard deviation of notional volumes.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1):** Add the missing fourth subplot, which should be a heatmap displaying the correlation matrix of midpoint prices. Annotate each cell with the correlation coefficient.\n6.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Use a professional style with a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   Adopt a harmonious and professional color palette. Avoid neon or overly saturated colors.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title and subplot titles bold and larger than axis labels.\n    *   Ensure all text labels are correct, descriptive, and relevant to the cryptocurrency data requested.\n    *   Use `plt.tight_layout()` or a similar function to ensure adequate spacing between all subplots and prevent any overlap of titles or labels."
