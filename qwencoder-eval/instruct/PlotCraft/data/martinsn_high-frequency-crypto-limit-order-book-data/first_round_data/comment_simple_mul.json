    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be completely redone. It does not meet any of the core requirements of the task.\n\n1.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the three horizontal bar charts with a single line chart (a 1x1 layout). This is the correct type for showing trends over time.\n2.  **Axes Configuration:**\n    *   Set the x-axis to represent 'Time'.\n    *   Set the y-axis to represent 'Midpoint Price'.\n3.  **Data Plotting:**\n    *   Plot three separate lines on the single chart, one for each cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, ADA).\n    *   Each line should connect the data points for its respective currency, showing how its price changes over the time period.\n4.  **Legend and Labels:**\n    *   Remove the incorrect text labels ('Glarbnok', etc.) from the plot area.\n    *   Add a legend to the chart that clearly maps each line color to the correct cryptocurrency (e.g., 'BTC', 'ETH', 'ADA').\n5.  **Title and Axis Labels:**\n    *   Change the main title to something relevant, such as 'Cryptocurrency Midpoint Price Evolution'.\n    *   Ensure the title is bolded and has a larger font size than other text for a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Label the x-axis 'Time' and the y-axis 'Midpoint Price (USD)' or a similar appropriate unit.\n6.  **Y-Axis Scaling:** The prices of BTC, ETH, and ADA are vastly different. To fulfill the requirement of 'appropriate price scales', consider using a logarithmic scale for the y-axis. This will allow the price movements of all three currencies to be visible on the same chart. Alternatively, create three separate line charts in a 3x1 layout, each with its own y-axis scale, but ensure they are correctly formatted as line charts showing time on the x-axis.\n7.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Use a professional color palette with distinct but harmonious colors. Avoid the current neon colors.\n    *   Set the chart background to white.\n    *   If gridlines are used, make them light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data lines."
