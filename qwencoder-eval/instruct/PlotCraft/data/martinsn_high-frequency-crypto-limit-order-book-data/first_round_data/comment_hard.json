    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Complete Task Requirements**: The most critical change is to add the missing correlation heatmap to subplot (2, 2) as required by the prompt. The title should then be updated to reflect both visualizations, e.g., 'Correlation Matrix & Rolling Correlation'.\n2. **Enhance Color Contrast**: \n   - In subplot (2, 0), change the color of the 'Avg Distance' line from white to a high-contrast color like black or dark purple to make it clearly visible against the yellow heatmap.\n   - In subplot (1, 1), make the 'Imbalance Ratio' line significantly thicker and change its color to something that stands out, like bright yellow or magenta.\n   - In subplot (1, 1), if the 'Bid Depth' is a stacked area chart, use more distinct shades of gray or different colors to differentiate the layers.\n3. **Improve Axis and Text Clarity**:\n   - Correct the x-axis of subplot (2, 2). It should display time, consistent with the other plots, not the single incorrect label 'ADA'.\n   - Ensure all x-axis tick labels on the bottom row are fully visible and not clipped. Consider using `plt.tight_layout()` or adjusting figure margins.\n   - For better readability, add shared x-axis tick labels to the bottom of each column (i.e., on subplots (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2)) so that the time scale is clear for the plots above them.\n4. **Refine Legends and Labels**:\n   - Add a comprehensive title for the entire 3x3 grid, such as 'Cryptocurrency Market Microstructure Dynamics for BTC, ETH, and ADA'.\n   - Ensure all legends are placed in a way that they do not obscure data; the current placement is good, but this should be maintained after adding new elements."
