    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is a complete failure to adhere to the task instructions. The chart must be entirely regenerated to meet the prompt's requirements.\n\n**1. Task Compliance Corrections (Complete Redo Required):**\n- **Global:** Use the specified 1-minute frequency data for all subplots and ensure all time axes are synchronized.\n- **Subplot (0, 0):** Re-plot as a line chart for the midpoint prices of BTC, ETH, and ADA. Overlay this with filled areas (not bars) representing the bid-ask spread for each respective currency.\n- **Subplot (0, 1):** Re-plot as a stacked area chart showing the cumulative trading volume (buys + sells) for BTC, ETH, and ADA over time.\n- **Subplot (1, 0):** Re-plot as a multi-line plot showing the distance of the first bid and ask levels from the midpoint for all three cryptocurrencies. Add error bands to represent volatility as requested.\n- **Subplot (1, 1):** Re-plot as a heatmap-style visualization that shows the evolving correlation matrix between the three cryptocurrencies' price movements over time.\n- **Text:** Update all subplot titles to accurately reflect the requested content (e.g., 'Midpoint Price and Bid-Ask Spread (BTC, ETH, ADA)'). Change the main title to remove 'Across Different Time Frequencies' as it contradicts the prompt.\n\n**2. Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n- **Background and Grid:** Switch to a professional, publication-ready style. Set the figure background to white. If gridlines are used, they should be thin, light gray, and non-intrusive.\n- **Typographic Hierarchy:** Ensure the main title is the most prominent text element (large, bold). Make all four subplot titles bold and slightly smaller than the main title to create a clear hierarchy.\n\n**3. Color Scheme:**\n- When re-plotting, establish a consistent and professional color palette across all four subplots. Assign a specific, distinct color to each cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC=Orange, ETH=Blue, ADA=Purple) and use these colors consistently throughout the entire figure."
