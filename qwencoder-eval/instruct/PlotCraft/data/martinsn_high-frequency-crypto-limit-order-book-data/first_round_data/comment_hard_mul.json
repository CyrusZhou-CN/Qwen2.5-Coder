    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the complete absence of data visualization. The chart is an empty template. To fulfill the task, the following must be implemented:\n\n1.  **Data Plotting (Essential):**\n    *   **Subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2):** Plot the time series data for midpoint prices at 1sec, 1min, and 5min frequencies. Overlay the calculated volatility bands. On the secondary y-axis, plot the line chart for cumulative buy/sell volume imbalance.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Generate and display the multi-cryptocurrency correlation heatmap. Overlay this with the time series plots of the specified cross-correlation coefficients.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create the stacked area chart showing the evolution of total order book depth for each cryptocurrency. Add the line overlays showing bid-ask spread dynamics.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 2):** Create the composite chart featuring violin plots of spread distributions and the connected scatter plots showing the relationship between average spread and trading volume intensity.\n\n2.  **Text and Labeling Improvements:**\n    *   **Subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2):** Add a descriptive label to the secondary (right) y-axis, such as 'Cumulative Volume Imbalance'.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 2):** Add an appropriate label to the x-axis, which might vary depending on the chart type (e.g., 'Crypto-Timeframe' for the violin plots).\n\n3.  **Legend Optimization:**\n    *   Populate the empty legend boxes in each subplot with clear and concise labels corresponding to the different data series being plotted (e.g., '1s Midpoint', '1m Midpoint', 'Volatility Band', 'Volume Imbalance')."
