It must be discarded and created again from scratch. \n\nTo fulfill the request, follow these steps:\n1.  **Start Over:** Create a new, single plot figure (a 1x1 layout).\n2.  **Chart Type:** Use a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'Monthly_Income' data.\n3.  **Binning:** Choose a suitable number of bins to clearly illustrate the salary distribution. Around 20-30 bins is often a good starting point, but this should be adjusted based on the data's range and shape.\n4.  **Titles and Labels:**\n    *   Set the main title of the plot to 'Distribution of Monthly Income'.\n    *   Set the x-axis label to 'Monthly Income ($)'.\n    *   Set the y-axis label to 'Number of Employees'.\n5.  **Mean Line:** Calculate the mean of the 'Monthly_Income' data and add a vertical line at that value on the x-axis. Use a distinct color (e.g., red) and a dashed line style to make it stand out. Add a legend to identify this line as 'Mean Income'.\n6.  **Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a standard white background for the chart.\n    *   Use a single, professional color (e.g., steelblue or darkgray) for the histogram bars.\n    *   Ensure all text is black or dark gray for high readability.\n    *   If using gridlines, make them light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data.\n    *   Remove all extraneous text overlays, watermarks, and error messages."
