    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch. The primary goal should be to follow the user's prompt precisely.\n1.  **Layout and Content:** Re-generate the entire figure as a 3x3 subplot grid. Each subplot must contain the specific chart type and data analysis requested in the prompt. For example:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Must be a stacked bar chart of department-wise attrition rates with an overlaid line plot of average job satisfaction.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Must be a scatter plot of Monthly Income vs. Years at Company, with points colored by attrition status.\n    *   This process must be repeated for all nine specified subplots.\n2.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   **Background and Grid:** Use a standard white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines to ensure a professional, publication-ready appearance.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Replace the current jarring color scheme with a professional, harmonious palette. Use color intentionally to encode data categories (e.g., a consistent color for 'Attrition: Yes' and another for 'Attrition: No' across all relevant plots).\n3.  **Text and Labels:**\n    *   **Titles:** The main title should be 'Employee Attrition Patterns Across Organizational Segments'. Each subplot must have a clear, descriptive title corresponding to the prompt (e.g., 'Department-wise Attrition & Job Satisfaction').\n    *   **Axes:** All axes must be clearly and accurately labeled (e.g., 'Monthly Income ($)', 'Years at Company', 'Attrition Rate').\n4.  **Clarity:** Remove all distracting watermarks and annotations. The final chart should be clean, uncluttered, and focused entirely on presenting the data clearly."
