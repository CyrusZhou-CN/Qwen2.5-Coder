    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and does not address the prompt in any way. It must be recreated from scratch. Here are the steps to create the correct visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout and Formatting:**\n    *   Start by creating a 2x2 subplot grid using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)`. Use a white background for a professional appearance.\n    *   Apply a clean, professional style (e.g., `plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')`) which provides a white background and subtle gridlines.\n    *   Use `plt.tight_layout()` at the end to ensure there is no overlap between subplots.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Correlation Heatmap:**\n    *   Use `seaborn.heatmap()` on the specified correlation matrix.\n    *   Choose a suitable diverging colormap like `'coolwarm'` or `'vlag'` to clearly distinguish positive and negative correlations.\n    *   Set `annot=True` to display the correlation coefficients on the heatmap cells.\n    *   Set the title to 'Correlation Matrix of Key Variables'.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Scatter Plot with Best Fit Line:**\n    *   Use `seaborn.regplot()` or `seaborn.scatterplot()` with `hue='Attrition'` to plot `Monthly_Income` vs. `Years_at_Company`.\n    *   Ensure a legend is present and clearly indicates the colors for each `Attrition` status.\n    *   Set an appropriate title, such as 'Monthly Income vs. Years at Company by Attrition'.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Scatter Plot with Sized Points:**\n    *   Use `seaborn.scatterplot()` to plot `Job_Satisfaction` vs. `Performance_Rating`.\n    *   Use the `size='Training_Hours_Last_Year'` parameter to encode the third variable in the point sizes.\n    *   Include a size legend to explain what the different point sizes represent.\n    *   Set the title to 'Job Satisfaction vs. Performance Rating'.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Pair Plot:**\n    *   A full pair plot is a grid in itself and cannot be placed directly into a single subplot axis. The prompt is slightly ambiguous here. A better approach would be to create a single scatter plot from this group, for example, `Work_Life_Balance` vs. `Job_Satisfaction`, colored by `Attrition`. \n    *   If a pair plot is strictly required, it should be generated as a separate figure. To fulfill the 2x2 grid, a representative scatter plot from the pair plot (e.g., `Work_Life_Balance` vs. `Job_Satisfaction`) should be placed in this subplot using `seaborn.scatterplot()` with `hue='Attrition'`.\n    *   Set the title to 'Work-Life Balance vs. Job Satisfaction by Attrition'."
