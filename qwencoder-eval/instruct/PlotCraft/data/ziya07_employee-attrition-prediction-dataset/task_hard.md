## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing employee attrition patterns across different organizational segments. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1,1) Department-wise attrition rates with stacked bar chart overlaid with line plot showing average job satisfaction per department, (1,2) Age group clusters using scatter plot of Monthly Income vs Years at Company with points colored by attrition status and sized by performance rating, (1,3) Job level hierarchy analysis with grouped bar chart showing attrition counts by job level overlaid with violin plots of work-life balance distributions, (2,1) Marital status segments with pie chart composition of attrition within each status group combined with box plots of distance from home, (2,2) Overtime work patterns using stacked area chart of project count distribution by overtime status with error bars showing average hours worked, (2,3) Manager relationship clusters with radar chart showing average ratings (job satisfaction, work environment satisfaction, job involvement) for different relationship quality levels overlaid with scatter points of individual employees, (3,1) Training engagement groups using histogram of training hours with KDE overlay, segmented by attrition status and annotated with mean absenteeism rates, (3,2) Career progression clusters with bubble chart plotting Years Since Last Promotion vs Years in Current Role, where bubble size represents monthly income and color represents department, (3,3) Work intensity segments combining heatmap of correlation between average hours worked, project count, and performance rating with marginal histograms showing distributions by gender.
