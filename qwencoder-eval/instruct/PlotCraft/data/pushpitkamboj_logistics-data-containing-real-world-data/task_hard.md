## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing delivery delay patterns across different customer and order characteristics. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Customer segment distribution with overlaid profit margins using stacked bars with line overlay, (2) Top-center: Geographic clustering of orders by market regions with bubble sizes representing sales volume and color-coded by delay status, (3) Top-right: Payment type analysis showing both count distribution and average profit ratios using grouped bars with error bars, (4) Middle-left: Shipping mode effectiveness combining delivery status proportions with average shipping duration using stacked percentage bars with trend lines, (5) Middle-center: Product category performance matrix showing delay rates vs profit margins with bubble sizes for order quantities, (6) Middle-right: Customer city clustering analysis showing delay patterns by geographic proximity using hierarchical clustering visualization with heatmap overlay, (7) Bottom-left: Temporal analysis combining order date trends with seasonal delay patterns using dual-axis time series with moving averages, (8) Bottom-center: Order status progression analysis showing state transitions with sankey-style flow visualization combined with delay probability distributions, (9) Bottom-right: Multi-dimensional customer profiling combining customer segment, geographic region, and payment behavior using parallel coordinates plot with density overlays for delay prediction insights.
