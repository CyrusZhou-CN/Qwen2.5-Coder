    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart, the following improvements are recommended:\n1.  **Correct Text Artifacts:** Immediately remove the erroneous text elements '$-3.6' and '$-3.7' from the empty space to the left of subplot (0, 0).\n2.  **Revise Diverging Bar Chart (Subplot 0, 0):** The primary task requirement was missed here. This chart must be recreated to show the profit deviation for both 'On-time/Early' and 'Delayed' deliveries for each shipping mode. This could be implemented as grouped horizontal bars for each shipping mode, using the same green and salmon colors from the box plot to ensure consistency.\n3.  **Improve Layout and Alignment:** Vertically align the plot areas of the two subplots so that the y-axes start and end at the same height. Reduce the excessive horizontal gap between subplot (0, 0) and (0, 1) to create a more integrated and visually balanced composite chart.\n4.  **Clarify Box Plot X-Axis (Subplot 0, 1):** The x-axis labeling is confusing. To fix this, either:\n    a) Center the shipping mode labels ('Standard Class', etc.) under each pair of box plots and remove the 45-degree rotation for better readability.\n    b) Create a hierarchical axis with the shipping mode as the primary label and 'On-time'/'Delayed' as secondary labels below each box.\n5.  **Add a Unified Title:** Create a single, overarching title for the entire figure (e.g., 'Profitability Analysis by Shipping Mode and Delivery Status') and convert the current plot titles into more concise subtitles for each subplot."
