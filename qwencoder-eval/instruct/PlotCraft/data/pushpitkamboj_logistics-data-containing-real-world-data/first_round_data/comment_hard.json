    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Fix Generation Errors**: The highest priority is to debug and fix the code that causes errors in subplots (2, 0) 'Temporal Analysis' and (2, 1) 'Order Status Analysis' so that the correct charts are generated.\n2. **Correct Chart Implementations**: \n   - In subplot (1, 2), replace the simple heatmap with a proper hierarchical clustering visualization, such as a clustermap that includes dendrograms for both rows and columns.\n   - In subplot (2, 1), implement the requested Sankey diagram to show state transitions.\n   - In subplot (2, 2), add the specified density overlays to the parallel coordinates plot to provide insights into delay prediction.\n3. **Resolve Text Overlap**: In subplot (1, 1), use a text-repelling algorithm (e.g., the `adjustText` library in Python) to automatically position the category labels so they do not overlap.\n4. **Correct Axis Labels**: In subplot (2, 2), change the x-axis tick labels from 'Delay Rate' and 'Profit Margin' to the actual dimensions being plotted as requested in the prompt (e.g., 'Customer Segment', 'Region', 'Payment Type').\n5. **Enhance Layout and Spacing**: Increase the vertical spacing between the rows of subplots (e.g., using `plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`) to provide more breathing room between the bottom of one plot and the title of the plot below it.\n6. **Standardize Color Palette**: For improved coherence, use a consistent color mapping for the 'Delay Status' category ('Delayed', 'Early', 'On Time') across all subplots where it appears, such as (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0)."
