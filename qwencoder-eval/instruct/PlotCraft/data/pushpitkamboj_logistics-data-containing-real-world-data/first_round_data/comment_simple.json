    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is the severe overlap of the histograms, making it uninterpretable. Here are specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Resolve Overlap:** Instead of overlaying opaque histograms, use one of the following methods:\n    *   **Faceting (Recommended):** Create a 2x2 grid of subplots, with each subplot showing the histogram for a single shipping mode. This would provide the clearest comparison.\n    *   **Transparency:** If you must overlay the plots, set a transparency level (e.g., `alpha=0.5`) for each histogram so that all distributions are visible.\n    *   **Step Histogram:** Change the histogram type to a step plot (`histtype='step'`), which only draws the outlines of the bins, making it much easier to see overlapping distributions.\n\n2.  **Differentiate Mean Lines:** The vertical mean lines must be distinguishable.\n    *   **Color-Code Lines:** Make each vertical mean line the same color as its corresponding histogram (e.g., a blue dashed line for 'Standard Class', a green dashed line for 'Second Class', etc.).\n    *   **Vary Line Styles:** Alternatively, use distinct line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted, dash-dot) for each mean and update the legend to reflect these styles.\n\n3.  **Refine Axis Limits:** Adjust the x-axis to better focus on the data. A range from approximately -1000 to 1000 would eliminate the excessive empty space on the left and provide a more detailed view of the distributions.\n\n4.  **Improve Legend and Labels:**\n    *   Ensure the legend accurately reflects what is plotted. If using faceting, a single legend might not be needed if each subplot is clearly titled with the shipping mode.\n    *   If overlaying, ensure the legend for the mean lines clearly distinguishes between them (e.g., 'Mean Standard Class (blue dashed)').\n\n5.  **Enhance Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Make the main title bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Add a light gray, subtle horizontal grid (`grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)`) to make it easier to read the frequency values from the y-axis."
