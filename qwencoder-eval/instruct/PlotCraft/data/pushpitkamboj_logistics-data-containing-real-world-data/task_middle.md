# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that analyzes delivery delay patterns by comparing profit performance across different shipping modes. Design a subplot with two charts: (1) a diverging bar chart showing the deviation of average profit per order from the overall mean for each shipping mode, and (2) a box plot displaying the distribution of profit per order across shipping modes with error bars indicating standard deviation. Use different colors to distinguish between delayed (label=1) and on-time/early (label=-1) deliveries, and highlight which shipping modes consistently underperform or overperform relative to the average profit baseline.
