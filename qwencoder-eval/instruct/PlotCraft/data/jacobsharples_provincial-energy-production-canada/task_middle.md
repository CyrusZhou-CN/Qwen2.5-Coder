## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the evolution of renewable vs non-renewable electricity generation in Canada from 2008 to 2022. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a stacked area chart displaying the monthly trends of renewable energy sources (hydraulic turbine, wind power turbine, solar, tidal power turbine) vs non-renewable sources (nuclear steam turbine, combustible fuels) over time, and (2) a line chart overlay showing the percentage contribution of renewable energy to total electricity generation each month. Use different colors to distinguish renewable and non-renewable sources, and ensure the percentage line is clearly visible with appropriate scaling.
