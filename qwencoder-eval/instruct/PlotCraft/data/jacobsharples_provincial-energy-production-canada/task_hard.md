## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the evolution of Canada's provincial electricity generation from 2008-2022. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1: Provincial Analysis
- Subplot 1: Stacked area chart showing total generation trends over time for top 5 provinces by total output, with overlaid line plots showing each province's individual trajectory
- Subplot 2: Dual-axis plot combining bar chart of average annual generation by province with line plot showing year-over-year growth rates
- Subplot 3: Heatmap of monthly generation patterns by province with overlaid contour lines indicating seasonal peaks

Row 2: Generation Type Analysis  
- Subplot 4: Multi-layered time series with stacked area chart for renewable vs non-renewable generation, plus individual line plots for each generation type
- Subplot 5: Bubble chart showing generation type efficiency over time (x-axis: year, y-axis: total output, bubble size: number of active provinces), with trend lines for each generation type
- Subplot 6: Violin plots showing distribution of monthly generation by type, overlaid with box plots and individual data points

Row 3: Producer and Comparative Analysis
- Subplot 7: Diverging bar chart comparing electric utilities vs industries generation by province, with error bars showing seasonal variation
- Subplot 8: Correlation matrix heatmap of generation types with overlaid scatter plots showing strongest correlations
- Subplot 9: Time series decomposition showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of total national generation, with all three components plotted as separate but aligned line charts

Each subplot should include appropriate legends, annotations for significant events/changes, and consistent color schemes across related visualizations.
