    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the prompt's requirements. The following steps should be taken:\n1. **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a single (1x1) plot. This plot should contain a stacked area chart showing the generation amounts for each energy source over time. An overlaying line chart should be added to this same plot to show the percentage of renewable energy.\n2. **Axes and Data:**\n   - The x-axis must represent the time period from 2008 to 2022.\n   - A primary y-axis (on the left) should be used for the stacked area chart, labeled 'Electricity Generation (e.g., GWh)'.\n   - A secondary y-axis (on the right) must be added for the line chart, scaled from 0 to 100 and labeled 'Renewable Energy Contribution (%)'.\n3. **Text and Labels:**\n   - The main title should be accurate and descriptive, such as 'Canadian Electricity Generation: Renewable vs. Non-Renewable (2008-2022)'.\n   - All nonsensical titles and labels ('Moose Population', 'Banana Units', etc.) must be removed and replaced with correct, data-relevant text.\n   - A clear legend is essential to identify the different energy sources in the stacked area chart and the percentage line.\n4. **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n   - Use a professional color palette. Assign a harmonious set of colors (e.g., shades of blue/green) to renewable sources and another set (e.g., shades of gray/orange) to non-renewable sources. Avoid the current harsh red/green combination.\n   - The chart background must be white.\n   - Gridlines, if used, should be subtle and light gray.\n   - The main title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
