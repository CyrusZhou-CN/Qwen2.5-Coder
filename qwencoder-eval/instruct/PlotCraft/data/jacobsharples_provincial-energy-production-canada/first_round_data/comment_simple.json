The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Fulfill the Core Task:** Discard all current charts and data. Create a single pie chart that visualizes the composition of electricity generation by type in Canada.\n2.  **Correct Chart Type and Layout:** Use a single 1x1 layout containing only one pie chart.\n3.  **Use Correct Data and Labels:**\n    *   The chart title should be relevant, such as 'Composition of Total Electricity Generation in Canada by Source'.\n    *   Each slice of the pie should represent an actual electricity generation type (e.g., 'Hydro', 'Nuclear', 'Wind', 'Solar', 'Natural Gas').\n    *   Labels on or next to each slice should clearly display the generation type and its percentage contribution to the total.\n4.  **Improve Color Scheme:** Replace the current garish colors with a professional, harmonious color palette. Use a qualitative color scheme where each color is distinct but the set is visually pleasing. Avoid using pure, fully saturated primary colors.\n5.  **Enhance Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Use a clean white background.\n    *   Remove the gridlines, as they are unnecessary for a pie chart.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and larger than the slice labels.\n    *   Ensure there is ample white space around the chart and its title for a clean, uncluttered appearance."
