    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Task Compliance:** The primary focus must be on implementing the correct composite chart types for each subplot as specified in the prompt. This includes changing subplot (1,1) to a bubble chart, (1,2) to a violin plot, and adding all the missing overlays (lines, contours, error bars, scatter plots) and components (e.g., the 'residual' in the decomposition plot) to the other subplots. The decomposition in (2,2) must be split into three separate, vertically aligned charts.\n2. **Layout and Spacing:** Use a function like `tight_layout()` with padding or manually adjust subplot spacing (`subplots_adjust`) to increase the vertical and horizontal gaps between plots. This will prevent titles and labels from overlapping. Increase the top margin to create clear separation between the main title and the first row of subplots.\n3. **Text and Labels:**\n    - Correct the y-axis labels in subplots (0,1) and (2,0) to accurately reflect the data's scale (e.g., 'Generation (GWh)' or 'Generation (10^9 MWh)').\n    - Reposition the y-axis label 'Province' in subplot (0,2) so it is correctly aligned with the y-axis.\n    - Address the overlapping x-tick labels in (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1) by increasing the figure's width, reducing the number of ticks, or using a less severe rotation angle (e.g., 30 degrees) with right-alignment.\n4. **Color and Consistency:** Define a consistent color palette for categorical variables like 'Province' and 'Generation Type' and apply it uniformly across all relevant subplots to aid comparison.\n5. **Professional Formatting:** Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title significantly larger and bolder than the subplot titles. Ensure all subplot titles are consistently formatted (e.g., all bolded). Add the requested annotations for significant events to provide context."
