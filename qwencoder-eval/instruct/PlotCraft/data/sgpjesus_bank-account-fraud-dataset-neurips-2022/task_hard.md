## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing fraud detection patterns across different dataset variants. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): For Base.csv, Variant I.csv, and Variant II.csv - create scatter plots with credit_risk_score vs income, colored by fraud_bool, overlaid with marginal histograms showing the distribution of each variable along the axes.

Bottom row (3 subplots): For Variant III.csv, Variant IV.csv, and Variant V.csv - create violin plots showing the distribution of session_length_in_minutes grouped by employment_status, with individual data points overlaid as strip plots, and box plots embedded within each violin to show quartiles.

Each subplot should include proper titles indicating the dataset variant, color-coded legends, and appropriate axis labels. The overall figure should reveal how different synthetic bias conditions affect the clustering and distribution patterns of key fraud detection features across the dataset variants.
