# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals bias patterns across different dataset variants by comparing fraud detection rates and risk profiles against baseline expectations. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A diverging bar chart showing fraud rate deviations from the overall mean across all variants, with bars extending left/right from a central zero line; (2) Top-right: A dumbbell plot comparing credit risk score distributions between Base dataset and Variant IV, showing the range differences for each income bracket; (3) Bottom-left: An error bar chart displaying mean session length with confidence intervals across variants, highlighting which variants deviate significantly from expected user behavior; (4) Bottom-right: A slope chart tracking how employment status fraud risk changes from Base to Variant III, with separate lines for each employment category showing the direction and magnitude of bias shifts.
