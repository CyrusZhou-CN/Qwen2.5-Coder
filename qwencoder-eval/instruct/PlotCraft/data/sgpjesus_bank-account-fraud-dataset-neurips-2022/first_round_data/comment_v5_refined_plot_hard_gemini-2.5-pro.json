    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated output is not a chart; it is only a title. The entire visualization needs to be created from scratch according to the prompt. \n1. **Generate the Layout:** Create a 3x2 grid of subplots.\n2. **Create Top Row Charts:** For subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2), generate the scatter plots of `credit_risk_score` vs `income` with marginal histograms for the `Base`, `Variant I`, and `Variant II` datasets, respectively. Ensure the scatter points are colored by `fraud_bool`.\n3. **Create Bottom Row Charts:** For subplots (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2), generate the composite violin plots of `session_length_in_minutes` grouped by `employment_status` for the `Variant III`, `Variant IV`, and `Variant V` datasets. Overlay strip plots and embed box plots within each violin.\n4. **Add Titles and Labels:** Each of the six subplots must have a specific title indicating the dataset variant it represents (e.g., 'Base Dataset', 'Variant I', etc.). All subplots need clear x and y axis labels.\n5. **Add Legends:** Include a legend for the `fraud_bool` coloring in the top-row scatter plots.\n6. **Overall Title:** The generated title 'Fraud Detection Pattern Analysis Across Dataset Variants' can be used as the main title (suptitle) for the entire 3x2 figure."
