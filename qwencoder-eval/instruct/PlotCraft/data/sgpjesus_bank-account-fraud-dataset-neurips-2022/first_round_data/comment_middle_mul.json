    "improvement_suggestions": "The fundamental issue is the failure to generate any of the requested visualizations. The primary suggestion is to populate the subplots with the correct chart types and data as specified in the prompt.\n\n1.  **Overall:** Generate the four specified charts. If actual data is unavailable, use representative placeholder or synthetic data to demonstrate the chart types.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-left:**\n    *   Add the required title, e.g., 'Fraud Rate Deviation from Mean'.\n    *   Implement a diverging bar chart. The y-axis should list dataset variants, and the x-axis should show deviation from zero. Bars for positive deviations should extend to the right, and bars for negative deviations to the left.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-right:**\n    *   Replace the 'Required datasets not available' text with a dumbbell plot.\n    *   The y-axis should represent 'Income Bracket'. For each bracket, plot two points for 'Base' and 'Variant IV' credit risk scores and connect them with a horizontal line.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-left:**\n    *   Add the required title, e.g., 'Mean Session Length with Confidence Intervals'.\n    *   Implement an error bar chart. The x-axis should list the dataset variants. For each variant, plot a point for the mean session length and add vertical error bars to represent the confidence intervals.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-right:**\n    *   Replace the 'Required datasets not available' text with a slope chart.\n    *   Create two vertical axes labeled 'Base' and 'Variant III'. For each 'Employment Status' category, draw a line connecting its fraud risk value on the 'Base' axis to its value on the 'Variant III' axis."
