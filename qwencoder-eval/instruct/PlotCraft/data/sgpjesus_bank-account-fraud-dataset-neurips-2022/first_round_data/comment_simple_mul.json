    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and cannot be salvaged. It must be completely redone to meet the user's request.\n1.  **Chart Type:** Replace the six pie charts with a single histogram on a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data Representation:** The x-axis of the histogram should represent 'Credit Risk Score', and the y-axis should represent 'Frequency' or 'Density'.\n3.  **Overlapping Distributions:** Plot the histograms for all dataset variants on the same axes to allow for direct comparison. \n4.  **Color and Transparency:** Assign a unique, professional color to each variant's distribution. Use a transparency (alpha) value around 0.6 to ensure that areas where the distributions overlap are clearly visible.\n5.  **Mean Lines:** For each variant, add a vertical dashed line at the position of its mean credit risk score. The color of the line should match the color of the corresponding distribution.\n6.  **Legend:** Add a legend to the chart that clearly identifies which color corresponds to which dataset variant.\n7.  **Titles and Labels:** Provide a clear and accurate main title, such as 'Distribution of Credit Risk Scores by Variant'. Label the x-axis ('Credit Risk Score') and y-axis ('Frequency') correctly.\n8.  **Professional Formatting:** Use a standard white background. Select a harmonious and accessible color palette (e.g., from a tool like ColorBrewer) instead of the current neon colors. Ensure all text is legible and remove the irrelevant 'GLARBNOK REVENGE DATA' text."
