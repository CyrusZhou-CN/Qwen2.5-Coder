    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and must be recreated from scratch to meet the user's request. \n1. **Chart Type and Layout:** Replace the current 2x1 layout of a pie chart and a bar chart with a single 1x1 histogram. \n2. **Data Representation:** The histogram's x-axis must represent the 'Credit Risk Score', and the y-axis must represent the 'Frequency' or 'Count' of applications. \n3. **Binning:** The histogram must be constructed using exactly 20 bins, as specified in the prompt. \n4. **Text Content:** The title should be changed to something informative, like 'Distribution of Credit Risk Scores'. The x-axis should be labeled 'Credit Risk Score' and the y-axis 'Number of Applications'. All nonsensical text ('Banana', 'Frobnication', 'Glarbnok') must be removed. \n5. **Color and Styling:** Use a professional, single-color palette for the histogram bars (e.g., a standard blue or gray). The chart background should be white, and any gridlines should be light gray and unobtrusive to ensure a clean, publication-ready appearance."
