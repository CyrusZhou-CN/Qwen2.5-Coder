    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete as it fails to plot any data. The primary suggestion is to debug the data plotting process. Specific improvements include:\n1.  **Data Plotting (Critical):**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Populate the top chart with the diverging horizontal bars representing the fraud rate deviations for each of the six dataset variants.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Populate the bottom chart with the dumbbell plots, showing the credit risk score ranges for fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent cases for each variant. The points for each dumbbell should be connected by a line.\n2.  **Axes and Labels:**\n    *   Add y-axis tick labels to both subplots to identify the six dataset variants.\n    *   Add a y-axis title to both plots, such as 'Dataset Variant', to provide context.\n3.  **Reference Lines:**\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), plot the vertical reference lines for the 'Overall Non-Fraud Avg' and 'Overall Fraud Avg' as requested. Ensure the data feeding these lines is correct.\n4.  **Legend Content:**\n    *   Correct the data processing error that causes '(nan)' to appear in the legend text. The legend should reflect valid data or be removed if the data is unavailable."
