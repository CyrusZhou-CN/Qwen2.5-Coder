    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated output is not a chart; it is only a title. The entire visualization needs to be created from scratch based on the prompt. The primary suggestion is to re-attempt the generation, following all instructions. Key steps to follow are:\n1. **Create the Layout**: Generate a 3x2 grid of subplots.\n2. **Populate Top Row**: For subplots (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2), create the composite visualizations for the 'Base', 'Variant I', and 'Variant II' datasets, respectively. Each must include: a scatter plot of `credit_risk_score` vs `income` colored by `fraud_bool`, an overlaid box plot of `credit_risk_score` by `employment_status`, and marginal histograms for both axes.\n3. **Populate Bottom Row**: For subplots (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2), create the composite visualizations for 'Variant III', 'Variant IV', and 'Variant V'. Each must include: a hexbin plot of `velocity_6h` vs `velocity_24h` with fraud cases overlaid as red scatter points, an overlaid violin plot of `session_length_in_minutes` by `device_os`, and an embedded correlation heatmap for the specified velocity and risk features.\n4. **Add Text Elements**: Each of the six subplots must have a specific title indicating the dataset variant it represents (e.g., 'Base', 'Variant I'). All axes must be clearly labeled. Legends must be included where necessary (e.g., for the `fraud_bool` colors in the top row).\n5. **Apply Consistent Styling**: Use a consistent and professional color scheme across all plots to allow for easy comparison between the different dataset variants."
