# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that reveals how fraud detection patterns deviate across different dataset variants. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot shows a diverging bar chart comparing fraud rates (percentage of fraud_bool=1) across all six dataset variants, with bars extending from a central baseline to highlight positive and negative deviations from the overall mean fraud rate. The bottom plot should display a dumbbell plot showing the range of credit risk scores for fraudulent vs non-fraudulent cases in each variant, with connecting lines emphasizing the gap between these two groups. Use distinct colors to differentiate fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases, and add reference lines to show overall dataset averages.
