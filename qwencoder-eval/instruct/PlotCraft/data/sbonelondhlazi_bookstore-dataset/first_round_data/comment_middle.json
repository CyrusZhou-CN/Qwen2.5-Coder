    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart's concept is good, but its execution has critical flaws. Here are specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Legend Management (Highest Priority):** The current legend is unusable.\n    *   **Option A (Recommended): Group Categories.** The number of categories is too high for a color legend. Group them into a smaller number of high-level categories (e.g., 5-8 groups like 'Fiction', 'Non-Fiction', 'Science & Tech', 'Arts', 'Lifestyle'). Then, color the scatter plot points according to these new groups. This will create a manageable and useful legend.\n    *   **Option B (Alternative): Remove the Legend.** If grouping is not feasible, remove the category legend entirely. State in the title or a caption that points are colored to show diversity but not for individual identification. For example: 'Book Prices vs Star Ratings (Points Colored by Category)'.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   After addressing the legend, the overlap with the right histogram will be resolved. Ensure there is clear visual separation between the main scatter plot and the two marginal histograms. Increase the padding or adjust the subplot spacing.\n    *   The legend for the regression line should be placed in a corner of the main plot that has empty space, or integrated with the main category legend if one is kept.\n\n3.  **Marginal Plot Refinements:**\n    *   **Top Histogram (Price):** Remove the x-axis tick labels (10, 20, 30...) as they are redundant with the main plot's x-axis directly below it. The alignment is sufficient to convey the scale.\n    *   **Right Histogram (Rating):** Remove the y-axis tick labels and title ('Frequency'). The y-axis should be perfectly aligned with the main plot's y-axis, so the star rating values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are implicitly understood. The horizontal bars directly correspond to the discrete ratings.\n\n4.  **Text and Titles:**\n    *   Correct the truncated category names in the source data if you choose to implement the category grouping suggestion.\n    *   Ensure all titles ('Price Distribution', 'Book Prices vs Star Ratings...', 'Rating Distribution') have a consistent font size and weight for a cleaner look.\n\n5.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   If you group categories, use a distinct, qualitative, and colorblind-friendly color palette (e.g., Seaborn's 'colorblind' or Matplotlib's 'Tableau10') to ensure the new, smaller set of categories is easily distinguishable."
