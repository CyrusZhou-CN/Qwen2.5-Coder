    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart completely fails to meet the task requirements and must be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Task Fulfillment:** The primary action is to generate the correct chart type. Create a single histogram (1x1 layout) that visualizes the distribution of book prices. The x-axis should be 'Price' and the y-axis should be 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n2. **Specific Requirements:** Ensure the histogram is configured with exactly 15 bins as requested. Add a vertical line to indicate the mean price and label it clearly.\n3. **Titles and Labels:** The chart title should be descriptive, such as 'Distribution of Book Prices'. The x and y axes must be labeled correctly.\n4. **Professional Formatting:** To improve the quality, adopt professional standards. Use a white background. If gridlines are necessary, make them subtle (light gray, thin lines), preferably only horizontal (y-axis) gridlines. Use a clean and professional color palette, such as a single muted color for the histogram bars and a distinct, contrasting color for the mean line."
