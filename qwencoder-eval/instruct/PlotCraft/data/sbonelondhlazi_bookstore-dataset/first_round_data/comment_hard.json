    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n   - **Subplot (0,0):** Add the required marginal histograms along the top (x-axis) and right (y-axis) of the scatter plot.\n   - **Subplot (1,2):** Replace the current bar chart with a proper treemap visualization where rectangle area corresponds to book count and color intensity to average price.\n\n2. **Layout and Spacing:**\n   - Use a constrained layout manager (e.g., `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)`) to fix the overall spacing, eliminate the large gap between rows 2 and 3, and prevent titles from overlapping.\n   - Reduce the font size of the main title ('Comprehensive Book Market Analysis Dashboard') and position it higher to avoid collision with subplot titles.\n\n3. **Text and Label Readability:**\n   - **Subplot (0,1):** To fix the unreadable x-axis labels, either convert it to a horizontal bar chart or increase the overall figure width and rotate the labels 45 degrees with right-alignment (`ha='right'`).\n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Reduce the font size of the heatmap annotations to prevent them from overlapping. Use a contrasting font color (e.g., white) for annotations on dark-colored cells.\n   - **Across multiple subplots:** Correct all truncated labels (e.g., 'Young Adul' to 'Young Adult', 'Nonficti' to 'Nonfiction', 'Sequenti' to 'Sequential'). Adjust plot margins to ensure full text is visible.\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** Use a text repulsion library or algorithm to prevent node labels in the network graph from overlapping.\n\n4. **Element Positioning:**\n   - **Subplot (1,1):** Move the legend outside the radar plot area (e.g., using `bbox_to_anchor`) to prevent it from obscuring the data.\n\n5. **Visual Refinement:**\n   - **Subplot (2,0):** Improve the clarity of the parallel coordinates plot by setting a lower alpha value for the lines (e.g., `alpha=0.4`) to better visualize density and reduce visual clutter."
