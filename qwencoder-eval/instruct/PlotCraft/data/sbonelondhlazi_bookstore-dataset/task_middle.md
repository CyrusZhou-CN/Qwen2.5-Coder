## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between book prices and star ratings in the bookstore dataset. Design a scatter plot with price on the x-axis and star rating on the y-axis, where each point represents a book and is colored by book category. Overlay this scatter plot with a regression line to show the overall trend between price and rating. Additionally, add marginal histograms on the top and right sides of the main plot to show the distribution of prices and star ratings respectively.
