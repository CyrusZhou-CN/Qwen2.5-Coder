# Visualization Task - Middle

Ranking

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive ranking visualization that compares Udemy course performance across different metrics. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization elements:

1. Top-left: Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 15 courses by number of subscribers, with bars colored by rating (use a color gradient from red for lower ratings to green for higher ratings). Overlay scatter points at the end of each bar to show the number of reviews.

2. Top-right: Build a lollipop chart displaying the top 12 courses by rating, where the stem length represents the rating value and the circle size represents the number of subscribers. Color-code the circles by instructional level.

3. Bottom-left: Design a stacked horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 instructors by total subscribers across all their courses. Each bar should be segmented to show the contribution of individual courses, with different colors for each course.

4. Bottom-right: Create a slope chart comparing the top 8 courses, showing the relationship between their ranking by subscribers (left side) versus their ranking by number of reviews (right side). Connect corresponding courses with lines, using different line styles or colors to highlight courses that maintain similar rankings versus those that change significantly.

Include appropriate titles, labels, and legends for each subplot. Use consistent color schemes and ensure all text is readable.
