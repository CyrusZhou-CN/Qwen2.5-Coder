    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Overall Layout:** Increase the vertical space between the main title and the top row of subplots using `fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9, hspace=0.4, wspace=0.3)` to prevent title overlap and give plots breathing room. Increase the overall figure size to better accommodate long text labels.\n2. **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:** This subplot needs to be completely redone. It must be implemented as a lollipop chart, not a bar chart. Use `plt.stem` or a combination of `hlines` and `scatter` to create the stems and circles. The length of the stems should represent the 'Rating', the size of the circles should represent the 'Number of Subscribers', and the color of the circles should map to the 'Instructional Level' as defined in the legend.\n3. **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:** Relocate the course name labels from inside the plot area to the y-axis tick labels to eliminate overlap and improve readability. This will require adjusting the subplot's left margin to make space for the full text. The y-axis should be explicitly labeled 'Rank by Subscribers' and a secondary y-axis on the right should be labeled 'Rank by Reviews'.\n4. **Text and Labels:**\n   - For subplots (0, 0) and (1, 0), expand the left margin to prevent y-axis labels (course and instructor names) from being truncated.\n   - Reformat the x-axis tick labels on subplots (0, 0) and (1, 0) from scientific notation (e.g., `1.50 1e6`) to a more readable format like '1.5M'.\n5. **Legends and Annotations:**\n   - In subplot (0, 0), add a legend or a clear annotation to explain that the overlaid scatter points represent the 'Number of Reviews'.\n   - In subplot (1, 0), add a legend to clarify what course each colored segment in the stacked bars represents. If a full legend is too cluttered, consider an alternative like annotating the largest segment for each instructor."
