    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several critical changes are needed to meet the task requirements and enhance quality:\n\n1.  **Subplot (0, 0) - K-means Clustering:**\n    *   **Fulfill Task:** The primary task was missed. You must perform K-means clustering (k=3) on the data. Then, re-plot the scatter plot by coloring the points according to their assigned cluster ID, not their instructional level. Add visual elements like semi-transparent polygons (convex hulls) or contour lines to explicitly show the cluster boundaries. Update the legend to reflect the clusters (e.g., 'Cluster 0', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 2').\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Dendrogram and Heatmap Layout:**\n    *   **Fix Overlap:** The heatmap must be moved from on top of the dendrogram to *below* it, as specified in the prompt. This requires creating a composite layout within the subplot's axes, with the dendrogram on top and the heatmap at the bottom. This will make both components fully visible and interpretable.\n\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Parallel Coordinates Clarity:**\n    *   **Reduce Clutter:** The plot is currently a 'hairball'. To improve clarity, emphasize the trend for each category. Plot the mean line for each instructional level with a thicker, opaque line. Then, plot the individual course lines in the background with a very high transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.1`) to show the distribution without overwhelming the primary trend.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Network and Radial Chart Redesign:**\n    *   **Implement Radial Bar Chart:** The current red bars are not a functional chart. Remove them and create a proper radial bar chart. For the top 10 instructors, draw bars extending outwards from the circle perimeter. The length of each bar should correspond to the instructor's average rating. Label each bar with the instructor's name and/or rating value.\n    *   **Fix Labels:** The current instructor labels are illegible. Use a text repulsion algorithm (e.g., `adjustText` library) to automatically position the labels to avoid overlap. Alternatively, place labels further outside the circle and use thin lines to connect them to their corresponding nodes.\n    *   **Node Coloring:** Since the radial bar chart will now show the average rating, the node color is redundant. Consider making all nodes a single neutral color to reduce visual noise, or use color to encode a different categorical variable if available."
