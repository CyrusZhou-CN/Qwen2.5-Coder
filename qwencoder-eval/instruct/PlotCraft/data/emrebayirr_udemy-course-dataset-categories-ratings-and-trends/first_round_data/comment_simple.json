    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and does not address the user's prompt. It needs to be recreated from scratch.\n\n1.  **Chart Type:** Replace the pie chart and bar chart with a single histogram (`plt.hist`) to correctly visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (course ratings).\n2.  **Data and Labels:**\n    *   The title should be changed to something accurate, like 'Distribution of Udemy Course Ratings'.\n    *   The x-axis should represent the 'Course Rating' and be labeled accordingly.\n    *   The y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Number of Courses' and be labeled as such.\n3.  **Binning:** Select an appropriate number of bins for the histogram to clearly reveal the shape of the rating distribution. For example, if ratings are on a 1-5 scale, 20-30 bins might be a good starting point.\n4.  **Annotations:**\n    *   Instead of placing summary statistics on the bars, create a single, clean text box in an empty area of the plot (e.g., the top-right corner) to display the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n    *   For better visual interpretation, consider adding vertical lines on the histogram to mark the positions of the mean and median (`ax.axvline`).\n5.  **Aesthetics and Formatting:**\n    *   Adopt a professional and clean visual style. Use a white background and subtle, light-gray gridlines.\n    *   Use a single, non-garish color for the histogram bars, such as a standard blue or gray.\n    *   Ensure all text is black or dark gray for maximum readability.\n    *   Establish a clear visual hierarchy by making the main title bold and slightly larger than the axis labels."
