Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the revenue composition of this e-commerce business. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot displays a pie chart showing the revenue distribution across different countries, and the right plot shows a horizontal stacked bar chart breaking down the revenue contribution by customer segments (based on CustomerNo) within each country. Calculate revenue as Price × Quantity for each transaction, and ensure both plots use consistent color schemes to represent the same countries.
