    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, the primary focus should be on adhering to the task prompt, followed by significant formatting enhancements.\n\n**Task Compliance Corrections:**\n1.  **Subplot (0,0):** Re-implement as a *stacked* horizontal bar chart.\n2.  **Subplot (0,2):** Replace the bubble chart with the requested *treemap* to properly show hierarchical composition.\n3.  **Subplot (1,0):** Ensure the horizontal bar chart is *stacked* as requested.\n4.  **Subplot (1,2):** Add the required *marginal bar charts* along the top and right edges of the heatmap to show total quantities and revenues.\n5.  **Subplot (2,0):** Change the visualization to a *histogram* and overlay the KDE curve on top of it, rather than showing only the KDE.\n6.  **Subplot (2,2):** Add the specified *surrounding ring chart* to the waffle chart to display country contribution percentages.\n\n**Visual and Formatting Improvements:**\n1.  **Clarity and Overlap:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** To fix the unreadable labels on the donut chart, either group the smallest segments into an 'Others' category or remove the direct labels and use a legend instead.\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Increase the vertical spacing between the main title and the first row, and between all subplot rows, to reduce the cramped feeling. Use `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.3)` for better control.\n3.  **Text and Readability:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,0):** The y-axis label 'Top 20 Customers' is good, but the ticks should be removed as they are just indices. The bars themselves represent the customers.\n    *   **Subplot (1,0) & (2,0):** Format the axis tick labels to display full numbers with commas (e.g., '4,000,000' instead of '4e6') for improved readability.\n    *   **Subplots (0,2), (1,2), (2,1):** Avoid rotating x-axis labels where possible. If labels are long, consider using horizontal bar charts or abbreviating the labels.\n4.  **Professional Standards:**\n    *   **Unified Theme:** Adopt a consistent color palette across all nine subplots to create a cohesive and professional dashboard.\n    *   **Spines and Borders:** Remove the top and right axis spines from all Cartesian plots for a cleaner, modern look (`ax.spines[['top', 'right']].set_visible(False)`). The heavy black border around the waffle chart in subplot (2,2) should be removed or lightened significantly."
