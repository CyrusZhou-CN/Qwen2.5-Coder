    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete redesign from scratch as it fails on nearly every metric. The primary issue is a fundamental misinterpretation of the data aggregation required for the task.\n\n1.  **Correct Data Aggregation:** The instruction to break down revenue by 'customer segments' was misinterpreted as plotting every unique `CustomerNo`. Instead, you must first group customers into a small number of meaningful segments before plotting. For example, for each country, identify the top 5 customers by revenue and group all others into an 'Other' category. This will reduce the number of segments from thousands to just six, making the stacked bar chart readable.\n\n2.  **Fix the Layout:** Strictly implement the 1x2 subplot layout. Create two axes side-by-side with a reasonable overall figure size and aspect ratio (e.g., `figsize=(16, 7)`). This will prevent the extreme vertical stretching and place the plots correctly.\n\n3.  **Redesign Both Plots and Legends:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0) - Pie Chart:** Ensure labels for the pie slices do not overlap. If there are many small slices, consider using a legend or callout lines. Add a clear title like 'Revenue Distribution by Country'.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1) - Stacked Bar Chart:** After correcting the data aggregation, this chart will show bars for each country, with each bar having a few colored stacks representing the customer segments (e.g., Top 1, Top 2, ..., Other). Create a single, clear legend for these segments and place it in a suitable location, such as to the right of the plot. The y-axis should be labeled 'Country' and the x-axis 'Revenue'. Add a title like 'Revenue Breakdown by Customer Segment'.\n\n4.  **Implement a Sensible Color Scheme:**\n    *   For the pie chart, use a distinct color for each country.\n    *   For the stacked bar chart, use a different color palette (e.g., a sequential or qualitative one from a library like Seaborn or Matplotlib) to represent the customer segments. The prompt's request for 'consistent color schemes' is best interpreted as using clear, distinct palettes for each purpose, not reusing country colors for customer segments, which would be confusing.\n\n5.  **Ensure Professional Formatting:** Use a white background, add a clear main title for the entire figure (e.g., 'E-commerce Revenue Composition'), and ensure all text (titles, axis labels, tick labels) is legible, appropriately sized, and does not overlap."
