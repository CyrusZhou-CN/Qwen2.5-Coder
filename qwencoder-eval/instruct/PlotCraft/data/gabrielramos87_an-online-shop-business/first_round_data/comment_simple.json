    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue with this chart is its inability to display the heavily right-skewed price distribution effectively. The vast majority of data points are clustered in the first few bins, rendering the rest of the chart empty and uninformative.\n\n1.  **Use a Logarithmic Scale for the X-Axis:** The most critical improvement is to change the x-axis ('Price') to a logarithmic scale. This will expand the lower end of the price range, allowing the distribution of the majority of products to be seen clearly, while compressing the long tail of high-priced outliers. This directly addresses the task's requirement to show distribution patterns and identify common price ranges.\n\n2.  **Refine Binning Strategy:** After applying a log scale, experiment with the number of bins to find a balance that reveals the underlying structure without being too noisy.\n\n3.  **Improve Visual Hierarchy:** Make the title 'Distribution of Product Prices' bold to establish it as the primary piece of information and create a stronger typographic hierarchy.\n\n4.  **Subdue Gridlines:** The current gridlines are somewhat prominent. Lighten their color to a light gray (e.g., '#d3d3d3') to make them serve as a subtle guide without distracting from the data bars.\n\n5.  **Consider Data Filtering as an Alternative:** If a logarithmic scale is not desired, an alternative approach would be to create a separate, zoomed-in histogram for the most populated price range (e.g., prices from $0 to $50) to analyze that segment in detail."
