# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Composition

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the composition and structure of the e-commerce business across different dimensions. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Customer Analysis): 
- Subplot 1: Customer transaction volume composition - Create a stacked bar chart showing quantity distribution by customer, overlaid with a line plot showing cumulative percentage contribution
- Subplot 2: Customer spending patterns - Combine a pie chart showing revenue share by top customers with a donut chart in the center displaying average transaction value
- Subplot 3: Customer-country composition - Create a treemap showing customer distribution by country, with bubble size representing total spending and color intensity showing transaction frequency

Middle row (Product Analysis):
- Subplot 4: Product portfolio composition - Generate a horizontal stacked bar chart showing quantity sold by product category (group products by price ranges), overlaid with scatter points showing individual product profitability
- Subplot 5: Price-quantity relationship composition - Create a bubble chart where bubble size represents total revenue per product, with background violin plots showing price distribution density
- Subplot 6: Product performance matrix - Combine a heatmap showing product performance metrics with marginal bar charts displaying total quantities and revenues

Bottom row (Transaction Analysis):
- Subplot 7: Transaction size composition - Create a histogram showing transaction value distribution overlaid with a KDE curve, plus vertical lines marking quartiles
- Subplot 8: Transaction complexity analysis - Generate a stacked area chart showing cumulative product count per transaction, combined with a line plot showing average transaction value
- Subplot 9: Business composition overview - Create a multi-layer composition chart combining a waffle chart showing transaction type distribution (by size categories) with a surrounding ring chart showing country contribution percentages
