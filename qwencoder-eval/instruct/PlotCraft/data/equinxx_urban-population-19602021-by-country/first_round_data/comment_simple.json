    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete and requires the following improvements:\n1. **Plot Data:** The primary issue is the absence of data. Plot the urban population percentage from 1960-2020 for the top 5 most urbanized countries as lines on the chart.\n2. **Correct Axis Formatting:** The x-axis ticks must be corrected to display the years from 1960 to 2020. The y-axis ticks should be reformatted to show percentages (e.g., '80%', '90%', '100%') instead of decimals for better clarity.\n3. **Populate Legend:** The legend box is empty. It must be populated with the names of the five countries, with each name corresponding to its colored line.\n4. **Implement Color Scheme:** Assign a distinct and visually appealing color to each of the five lines to ensure they can be easily differentiated.\n5. **Improve Visual Hierarchy:** Make the chart title bold to give it more prominence and establish a clear visual hierarchy."
