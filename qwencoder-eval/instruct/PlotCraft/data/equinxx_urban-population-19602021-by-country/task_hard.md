# Visualization Task - Hard

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing urban population evolution patterns from 1960-2020. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (Regional Analysis): 
- Subplot 1: Line chart with confidence bands showing urban percentage trends for top 5 most populous countries, overlaid with scatter points marking significant inflection points
- Subplot 2: Stacked area chart showing absolute urban population growth by continent/region with trend lines for each region
- Subplot 3: Dual-axis plot combining bar chart of decadal growth rates with line plot of urbanization acceleration/deceleration

Middle row (Distribution Evolution):
- Subplot 4: Animated-style multiple histograms showing distribution of urban percentages across countries for 1960, 1990, and 2020, with KDE curves overlaid
- Subplot 5: Box plots with violin plot overlays showing urban percentage quartiles by decade, with outlier countries labeled
- Subplot 6: Heatmap of urban percentage changes with marginal histograms showing country-wise and year-wise distributions

Bottom row (Comparative Dynamics):
- Subplot 7: Slope chart connecting 1960 and 2020 urban percentages for all countries, with diverging color coding and trend classification
- Subplot 8: Bubble chart where x-axis is 1960 urban %, y-axis is 2020 urban %, bubble size represents total population, with regression line and prediction intervals
- Subplot 9: Time series decomposition plot showing trend, seasonal patterns, and residuals of global urbanization rate with autocorrelation subplot

Each composite chart must include appropriate legends, annotations for key insights, and consistent color schemes across the grid.
