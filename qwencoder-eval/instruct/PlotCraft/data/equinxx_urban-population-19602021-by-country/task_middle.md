# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Change

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing urbanization trends over time by analyzing both the rate of change and absolute growth patterns. Design a 2x1 subplot layout where the top plot combines a line chart showing the average global urban population percentage over time (1960-2020) with a shaded area chart displaying the range (min-max) of urbanization percentages across all countries for each year. The bottom plot should display a stacked area chart showing the cumulative urban population growth for the top 5 most populous urban countries in 2020, with each country represented as a different colored area. Include trend lines or annotations to highlight significant periods of acceleration or deceleration in global urbanization patterns.
