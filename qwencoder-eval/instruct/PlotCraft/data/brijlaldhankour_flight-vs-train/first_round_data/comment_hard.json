    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve the chart, focus on task compliance and resolving the text clarity issues. (1) **Task Compliance Fixes**: In subplot (0, 1), replace the current visualization with a proper dumbbell plot, where each week has a horizontal line connecting the 'Plane' and 'Train' price points. In subplot (2, 0), add the requested histogram of the deviation data, plotting it against the currently unused secondary y-axis ('Distribution Density'). (2) **Text and Layout Adjustments**: For subplot (2, 1), resolve the overlapping x-axis labels by either making the plot horizontal (so labels have vertical space) or by using shorter, abbreviated labels (e.g., 'MUM-DEL Plane'). For subplot (0, 0), the jitter plot points should be colored consistently (teal for plane, magenta for train) to distinguish between the two modes of transport, as the current coloring is ambiguous. (3) **Consistency**: Ensure consistent font sizes for titles and axis labels across all six subplots to create a more cohesive and professional final image."
