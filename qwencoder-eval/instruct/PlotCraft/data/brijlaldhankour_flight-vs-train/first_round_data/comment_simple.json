    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to create a diverging bar chart. To fix this, the chart's fundamental structure needs to be changed:\n1.  **Implement Diverging Structure:** The chart should be centered on a vertical line at x=0. Bars representing positive differences (Flights more expensive) should extend to the right, and bars for negative differences (Trains more expensive) should extend to the left. Even if the current dataset only contains positive values, the chart's x-axis should be structured to potentially accommodate negative values to be a true diverging chart.\n2.  **Improve Label Placement:** To make the layout more compact and balanced, place the value labels inside the bars at their ends. This would eliminate the large white space on the right and create a cleaner look. For example, the label '₹3574' could be right-aligned just inside the end of the top bar.\n3.  **Refine Text Formatting:** The axis labels ('Route' and 'Price Difference (₹)') are bold, which is slightly overpowering. Change their font weight to normal to create a better visual hierarchy, allowing the bold main title to stand out more effectively.\n4.  **Enhance Aesthetics:** For a more professional appearance, consider removing the top and right chart borders (spines). This is a common practice that makes the chart feel more open and modern.\n5.  **Title Conciseness:** The title is clear but could be slightly more concise. The subtitle '(Positive = Flights More Expensive)' is helpful but this information is also conveyed by the legend. Consider integrating this information more seamlessly, perhaps by just relying on the legend."
