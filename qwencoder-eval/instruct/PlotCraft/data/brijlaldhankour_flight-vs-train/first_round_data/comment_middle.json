    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to follow the prompt's core instruction for a composite, overlaid chart. The visualization should be redesigned to meet the task requirements.\n\n1.  **Fulfill Core Task:** Re-implement the chart as a single composite visualization. The most direct interpretation is to create a diverging bar chart and use a secondary y-axis to overlay the line plot. This would directly link the average absolute difference with the weekly percentage trends for each route as requested.\n2.  **Correct Chart Type:** The bar chart in subplot (0, 0) must be changed to a proper diverging bar chart. A vertical reference line should be placed at x=0, and bars should originate from this line. Even if all data points are positive, this format is required by the prompt to show deviation from parity.\n3.  **Revise Annotations:**\n    *   In subplot (0, 0), remove the boxed annotations ('Trains more expensive', 'Flights more expensive'). The diverging nature of the chart, centered on zero, makes this self-explanatory.\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), remove the confusing annotations ('Trains cheaper ↑', 'Flights cheaper ↓'). The y-axis label 'Percentage Difference (%)' and the reference line at zero are sufficient. If an explanation is needed, add a subtitle like 'Positive values indicate flights are more expensive'.\n4.  **Correct Text Content:** Fix the spelling errors on the y-axis labels of the top chart: 'mumbai-kolkatta' should be 'mumbai-kolkata' and 'mumbai-Banglore' should be 'mumbai-Bangalore'. Ensure consistency in the legend as well.\n5.  **Refine Formatting:**\n    *   In subplot (1, 0), change the thick black reference line at y=0 to a thinner, dashed gray line (e.g., `linestyle='--', color='grey'`) to make it less visually dominant.\n    *   If maintaining the two-plot layout, reduce the vertical spacing between the subplots to create a more unified visual block.\n    *   To improve the layout of subplot (1, 0), move the legend outside the plot area, for instance, to the top of the entire figure, to allow the line chart to occupy the full width."
