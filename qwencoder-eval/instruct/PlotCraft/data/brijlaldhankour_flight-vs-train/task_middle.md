# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the price difference between flights and trains across different routes in India. Design a subplot with two components: (1) a diverging bar chart displaying the absolute price difference (Flight Price - Train Price) for each route, with bars extending left for negative differences (trains more expensive) and right for positive differences (flights more expensive), and (2) a line plot overlay showing the percentage difference trends across the 6 weeks for each route. Use different colors to distinguish routes and add reference lines at zero difference to emphasize deviations from price parity.
