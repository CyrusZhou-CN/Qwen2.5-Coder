# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a diverging bar chart that shows the price difference between flights and trains for each route. Calculate the average ticket price for each mode of transport (Plane vs Train) across all routes, then create horizontal bars that extend left and right from a central zero line to show how much more expensive flights are compared to trains for each route. Use different colors for positive (flight more expensive) and negative (train more expensive) differences, and include the actual price difference values as labels on the bars.
