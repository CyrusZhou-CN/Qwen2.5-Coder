# Visualization Task - Hard

## Category
Deviation

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing flight vs train fare deviations across Indian routes. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types: (1) Top-left: Diverging bar chart with error bars showing mean price differences between flight and train for each route, overlaid with individual data points as jitter plots; (2) Top-right: Dumbbell plot comparing flight vs train prices across weeks with connecting lines, supplemented by a background area chart showing the price range envelope; (3) Middle-left: Slope chart tracking price changes over weeks for each mode of transport, enhanced with confidence intervals as shaded regions; (4) Middle-right: Radar chart displaying normalized price deviations from overall mean for each route-mode combination, overlaid with scatter points showing actual values; (5) Bottom-left: Diverging lollipop chart showing percentage price differences from the dataset median, combined with a histogram distribution of these deviations; (6) Bottom-right: Box plots comparing price distributions by mode and route, enhanced with violin plot overlays and mean markers connected by trend lines.
