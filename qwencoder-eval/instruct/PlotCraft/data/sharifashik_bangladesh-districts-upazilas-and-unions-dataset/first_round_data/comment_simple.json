    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical improvement is to fix the font rendering issue. The plotting environment must be configured to use a font that supports the Bengali script (e.g., 'Noto Sans Bengali', 'Kalpurush') to correctly display the district names on the y-axis. To enhance the chart's professionalism and readability, consider the following: (1) Make the chart title 'Top 15 Districts in Bangladesh Ranked by Number of Upazilas' bold to establish a clear visual hierarchy. (2) Add data labels (the exact count of upazilas) at the end of each bar to provide precise information and reduce the viewer's reliance on the x-axis. (3) The y-axis label 'Districts' is somewhat redundant given the chart's title; consider removing it to declutter the visualization. (4) Add subtle, light-gray horizontal gridlines to help guide the eye from the end of the bars to the x-axis values."
