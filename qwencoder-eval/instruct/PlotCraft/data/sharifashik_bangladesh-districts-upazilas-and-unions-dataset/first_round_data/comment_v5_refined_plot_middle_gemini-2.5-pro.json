    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incomplete and has a critical rendering error. The following improvements are required:\n1.  **Complete the Task:** The most important step is to generate the missing horizontal bar chart as specified in the prompt. This chart should be placed below the treemap and display the top 10 districts ranked by their total number of unions.\n2.  **Fix Text Rendering:** The empty boxes (tofu characters) must be resolved. This likely requires using a font that supports the characters needed for the upazila names. The text is currently unreadable.\n3.  **Add District Labels:** The treemap should have labels for the parent rectangles to identify which district each colored area represents. This would make the hierarchy much clearer.\n4.  **Implement Bar Chart Correctly:** When creating the bar chart, ensure the bars are horizontal, sorted in descending order of union count, and colored according to the number of upazilas in each district. A color bar legend will be necessary to interpret the bar colors.\n5.  **Add a Composite Title:** The entire figure should have a main title that describes both the treemap and the bar chart, with subtitles for each individual plot if necessary to maintain clarity."
