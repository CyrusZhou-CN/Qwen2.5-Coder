    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Fix Text Rendering:** The highest priority is to resolve the font encoding issue that renders most labels as '□□□'. Use a font that properly supports the characters in the dataset (e.g., a font with Bengali script support).\n2. **Correct Chart Implementations:**\n   - **Subplot (2,0):** Convert the simple bar chart into a stacked bar chart as required by the prompt.\n   - **Subplot (2,1):** Re-implement this as a proper correlation matrix and, crucially, add the hierarchical clustering dendrograms to both the x and y axes.\n   - **Subplot (1,0):** Add the missing 'Districts' axis to the parallel coordinates plot to fulfill the 'flow' visualization requirement.\n   - **Subplot (1,2):** Change the color encoding for the bubbles to represent 'upazila counts' instead of the current 'size categories'.\n   - **Subplot (2,2):** Re-structure the donut chart to show the correct hierarchy: districts in the inner ring and their corresponding upazilas/unions in the outer rings.\n3. **Improve Layout and Spacing:**\n   - Standardize the size and aspect ratio of all subplots for a balanced and professional grid.\n   - Increase the size of the heatmap subplot (2,1) to make it legible and proportional to the other charts.\n   - Adjust the spacing between rows and columns (`hspace`, `wspace`) to be even and adequate.\n4. **Enhance Readability:**\n   - **Subplots (0,1) and (2,0):** For the dendrogram and bar chart, rotate the x-axis labels 90 degrees or consider switching to horizontal plots to prevent label overlap.\n   - **Subplot (0,2):** In the network graph, use a layout algorithm that minimizes label collisions or reduce the font size of node labels.\n5. **Standardize Aesthetics:**\n   - Adopt a single, cohesive color palette for the entire dashboard to create a unified visual identity.\n   - Ensure all subplot titles have a consistent font size, weight, and alignment (e.g., all centered and bold).\n   - Change technical axis labels like 'upazila_count' in subplot (2,1) to more descriptive labels like 'Upazila Count'."
