Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the administrative structure of Bangladesh by combining a treemap and a horizontal bar chart. The treemap should display the hierarchical composition of districts, upazilas, and unions, where each district is represented as a rectangle subdivided by its upazilas, with the size of each section proportional to the number of unions within that upazila. Below the treemap, create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 districts ranked by their total number of unions, with bars colored by the number of upazilas in each district to show the relationship between administrative complexity and union count.
