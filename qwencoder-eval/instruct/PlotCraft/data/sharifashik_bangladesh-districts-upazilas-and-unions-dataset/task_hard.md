## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the hierarchical administrative structure of Bangladesh. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Treemap showing district sizes by number of upazilas with overlaid text labels, (2) Top-center: Hierarchical dendrogram clustering districts by their upazila distribution patterns, (3) Top-right: Network graph showing district-upazila relationships with node sizes representing union counts, (4) Middle-left: Parallel coordinates plot showing the flow from districts through upazilas to unions with color-coded paths, (5) Middle-center: Radar chart comparing the top 8 districts by administrative complexity (number of upazilas and unions) with dual-axis scaling, (6) Middle-right: Clustered bubble chart where districts are grouped by administrative size categories with bubble sizes representing union counts and colors representing upazila counts, (7) Bottom-left: Stacked bar chart showing upazila distribution per district with overlaid line plot of cumulative union percentages, (8) Bottom-center: Heatmap correlation matrix of district administrative metrics with hierarchical clustering dendrograms on both axes, (9) Bottom-right: Multi-level pie chart (donut chart) showing the composition hierarchy from districts to upazilas to unions with interactive-style nested rings.
