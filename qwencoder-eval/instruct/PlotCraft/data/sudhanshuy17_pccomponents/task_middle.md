Composition

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization showing the market composition of PC components by analyzing the price distribution across different component categories. Design a subplot layout with two complementary charts: (1) a pie chart displaying the proportion of components by category based on count of products, and (2) a horizontal stacked bar chart showing the price range distribution (budget: <₹5000, mid-range: ₹5000-₹20000, premium: >₹20000) across all component categories. Extract and clean price data from all CSV files, standardize the currency format, and ensure both visualizations work together to tell a comprehensive story about the PC components market structure.
