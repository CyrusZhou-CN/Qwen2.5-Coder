    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires a complete overhaul to meet the prompt's requirements. \n1. **Layout and Structure**: Re-implement the entire figure using a strict 3x2 grid layout. Ensure all 6 requested plots are generated and placed correctly. Use `fig.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or a similar function to automatically adjust spacing and prevent the severe title overlap seen in the current version. \n2. **Chart Type Correction**: Each subplot must be recreated with the correct chart types as specified in the prompt. \n   - **Subplot (0, 0)**: Replace the simple bar chart with a `stacked bar chart`. If the data doesn't have sub-categories for stacking, this should be noted, but the attempt must be made. \n   - **Subplot (0, 1)**: Completely replace the donut/bar combination with a `treemap` (e.g., using the `squarify` library) for market value, and add a small, inset `pie chart` for component counts. \n   - **Subplot (0, 2)**: Augment the existing waffle chart by adding `box plots` for Intel and AMD price distributions below it, within the same subplot axes. \n   - **Subplot (1, 0)**: Replace the scatter plot with a `stacked area chart` to show price ranges across component categories. Then, overlay the high-value outliers as scatter points. \n   - **Subplot (1, 1)**: Overlay the requested `radar chart` on top of the sunburst chart. Use transparency (e.g., `alpha=0.5`) for the radar chart to ensure the sunburst remains visible. \n3. **Text and Labels**: \n   - Use a main figure title (`fig.suptitle`) and individual subplot titles (`ax.set_title`) to create a clear hierarchy and avoid overlap. \n   - Correct the y-axis label in subplot (1, 0) to something meaningful like 'Cumulative Count' or 'Value (₹)'. \n   - Ensure all legends are clear, correctly positioned, and do not obscure data. \n4. **Color Consistency**: Implement a consistent color map for all component categories across all subplots. For example, if 'CPU' is red in the first plot, it should be the same shade of red in all other plots where it appears."
