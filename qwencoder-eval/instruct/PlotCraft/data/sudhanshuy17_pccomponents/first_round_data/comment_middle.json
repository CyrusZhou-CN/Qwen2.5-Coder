The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Task:** The primary action is to use the correct dataset (PC component prices) to create the specified visualizations. The current chart is entirely irrelevant.\n2.  **Correct Layout and Chart Types:**\n    *   Create a 1x2 or 2x1 subplot layout for the two required charts.\n    *   The first subplot, let's say at position (0, 0), must be a **pie chart** showing the proportion of products per component category.\n    *   The second subplot, at position (0, 1), must be a **horizontal stacked bar chart** showing the distribution of products into 'budget', 'mid-range', and 'premium' price tiers for each component category.\n3.  **Implement Professional Formatting:**\n    *   Switch to a standard **white background** with black or dark gray text for maximum readability.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be subtle (light gray, thin lines).\n    *   Use a professional and harmonious color palette. For the stacked bar chart, use a sequential or categorical color scheme that is easy to distinguish (e.g., shades of blue, or distinct colors like blue, orange, and green for the price tiers).\n4.  **Improve Text and Labels:**\n    *   Add a clear, overarching title for the entire figure, such as 'PC Component Market Composition and Price Analysis'.\n    *   Title the pie chart 'Component Distribution by Product Count'.\n    *   Title the bar chart 'Price Tier Distribution by Component Category'.\n    *   Ensure the pie chart slices are clearly labeled with category names and percentages.\n    *   For the bar chart, label the y-axis with 'Component Category' and the x-axis with 'Number of Products'.\n    *   Add a clear legend for the stacked bar chart to define the 'budget', 'mid-range', and 'premium' color segments.\n5.  **Refine Layout and Spacing:**\n    *   Ensure there is sufficient white space between the two subplots and around the entire figure to avoid a cramped appearance.\n    *   Adjust subplot sizes to be well-proportioned and visually balanced."
