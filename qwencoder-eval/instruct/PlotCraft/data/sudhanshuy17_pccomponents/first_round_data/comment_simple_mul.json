    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Data Compliance:** The primary issue is the data. The chart must be updated to display the top 10 most expensive CPUs as requested, not just two.\n2. **Color and Legend Accuracy:** Assign two distinct colors to represent AMD and Intel (e.g., red for AMD, blue for Intel). The legend must be corrected to accurately map these colors to the corresponding brands.\n3. **Ranking Order:** The bars should be sorted in descending order of price from top to bottom to clearly communicate the ranking.\n4. **Layout and Spacing:** Adjust the figure's height and the spacing between bars to create a more balanced and compact layout suitable for 10 items. The current vertical white space is excessive.\n5. **Text Formatting:** Make the chart title bold to improve the visual hierarchy. The y-axis labels are very long; consider shortening them (e.g., 'amd Ryzen 9 7950X' instead of the full description) to improve readability and layout balance.\n6. **Axis Labels:** The y-axis label 'CPU' is slightly misaligned; it should be centered relative to the y-axis ticks."
