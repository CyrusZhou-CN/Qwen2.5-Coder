    "improvement_suggestions": "The primary issue is the failure to meet the task's core requirement of analyzing multiple PC component categories. The entire chart should be regenerated using data that includes categories like GPU, RAM, Storage, etc.\n\nSpecific improvements for the current structure:\n1.  **Chart Type and Data Correction**: \n    - Subplot (1, 0): Must be changed to a 'grouped bar chart' showing product counts per price bracket for each brand. The current strip plot with an incorrect 'Product Count' y-axis is misleading and must be completely replaced.\n2.  **Color Consistency**: \n    - Establish a single, consistent color palette. Use one set of colors for brands (e.g., AMD=red, Intel=blue) and another for price brackets (e.g., Budget=green, Mid-range=yellow, Premium=blue) and apply them uniformly across all relevant subplots ((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1)).\n    - In subplot (1, 0), the scatter points (or bars, in the corrected version) should be colored according to the price bracket legend.\n3.  **Text and Label Adjustments**: \n    - In subplot (0, 1), reposition the 'Intel CPU' and '4.1%' labels to eliminate overlap and improve readability.\n    - Ensure all subplot titles have consistent formatting (e.g., all bold).\n4.  **Layout and Spacing Refinements**: \n    - Add a main `suptitle` for the entire 3x3 grid to provide overall context.\n    - In subplot (0, 0), move the 'Average Price' y-axis closer to the plot area.\n    - In subplot (1, 2), the 'Intel CPU' bubble is almost invisible. Consider using a logarithmic scale for bubble size if counts are extremely different. Reduce the height of the color bar to give more prominence to the plot area.\n    - In subplot (2, 2), move the legend outside the plot area to avoid collision with the chart's border.\n5.  **Visual Hierarchy**: \n    - Create a stronger typographic hierarchy. The main title should be largest and boldest, followed by subplot titles, and then axis labels. This will guide the viewer's attention more effectively."
