    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is completely incorrect and must be recreated from scratch to meet the task requirements. \n1. **Chart Type:** Replace the current scatter plot and pie chart with a single histogram. \n2. **Data Mapping:** The x-axis of the histogram must represent the 'AMD CPU Price', and the y-axis must represent the 'Frequency' (or count) of CPUs within each price range. \n3. **Title and Labels:** The title should be changed to 'Distribution of AMD CPU Prices'. The x-axis should be labeled 'Price (₹)' and the y-axis 'Frequency' or 'Number of CPUs'. \n4. **Remove Extraneous Elements:** The pie chart, the 'Banana Prices in Space' title, the 'Glarbnok's Revenge' text, and the incorrect axis labels must all be removed. \n5. **Color Scheme:** Use a professional and simple color palette. A single, solid color (e.g., a muted blue or gray) for the histogram bars would be appropriate. Avoid the current harsh green and red combination. \n6. **Binning:** Choose an appropriate number of bins (e.g., 15-25) for the histogram to clearly illustrate the shape of the price distribution without being too granular or too coarse. \n7. **Professional Formatting:** The chart should use a white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines for a clean, professional appearance. The title should be bolded to create a clear visual hierarchy."
