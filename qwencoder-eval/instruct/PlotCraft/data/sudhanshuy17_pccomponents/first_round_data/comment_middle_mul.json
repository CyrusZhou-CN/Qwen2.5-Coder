    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure to follow the user's prompt. The entire visualization needs to be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\n**Fundamental Corrections:**\n1.  **Adhere to the Task:** The primary issue is that the chart does not address the prompt at all. The new chart must be about 'price comparison analysis across PC components'.\n2.  **Correct Layout:** Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid.\n3.  **Correct Chart Types:** Use the specific chart types requested for each subplot:\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** A horizontal bar chart with an overlaid scatter plot.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** A stacked horizontal bar chart with an overlaid line plot.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** A lollipop chart with error bars.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** A dot plot with connecting lines and an annotation.\n\n**Visual and Quality Improvements for the New Chart:**\n1.  **Professional Formatting:** Use a white background for all subplots. Gridlines should be subtle (light gray, thin) to avoid distracting from the data.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Select a professional and harmonious color palette. Use distinct but not jarring colors to differentiate categories in the scatter plot (subplot 0,0) and price ranges in the stacked bar chart (subplot 0,1). Avoid the high-contrast primary colors used in the current image.\n3.  **Text and Labels:** Ensure all titles and axis labels are correct, relevant to PC component prices (e.g., 'Price (₹)', 'Component Category'), and legible. Establish a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., bold main title, regular-weight axis titles).\n4.  **Clarity and Spacing:** Arrange elements to ensure there is no overlap. Adjust subplot spacing (`plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`) to provide adequate white space and prevent titles/labels from crashing into adjacent plots.\n5.  **Annotations and Legends:** Place any legends or annotations (like the one required in subplot 1,1) carefully so they are easy to read and do not obscure data points."
