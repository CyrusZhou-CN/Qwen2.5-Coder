# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive price comparison analysis across PC components using a 2x2 subplot grid. Each subplot should combine multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 most expensive components across all categories (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) with overlaid scatter points indicating component type using different colors and shapes. (2) Top-right: Display a stacked horizontal bar chart showing price ranges (budget: <₹5000, mid-range: ₹5000-₹20000, high-end: >₹20000) for each component category, with a line plot overlay showing the average price per category. (3) Bottom-left: Generate a lollipop chart ranking component categories by their median prices, with error bars showing the interquartile range and color-coded markers based on price volatility. (4) Bottom-right: Create a dot plot showing the price distribution of the top 5 most expensive items in each category, with connecting lines between categories and annotations highlighting the most expensive overall component.
