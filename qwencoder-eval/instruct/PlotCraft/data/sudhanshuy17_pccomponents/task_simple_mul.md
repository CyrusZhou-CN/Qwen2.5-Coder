## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a horizontal bar chart comparing the top 10 most expensive CPU models between AMD and Intel processors. Extract the numeric price values from the MRP column (removing currency symbols and commas), then identify and visualize the top 10 highest-priced CPUs across both datasets. Use different colors to distinguish between AMD and Intel processors, add appropriate labels showing both the CPU name and price, and include a legend to clearly identify the processor brands.
