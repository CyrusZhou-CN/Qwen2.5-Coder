    "improvement_suggestions": "The most critical issue is the complete failure to render the visualization in the top subplot (0, 0). The primary action is to ensure the histogram with the overlaid KDE curve is correctly generated and displayed as per the prompt. Additionally, for the bottom subplot (1, 0), the legend is redundant because the x-axis ticks ('Portuguese', 'English') already provide the same information; removing this legend would declutter the plot. The annotations showing the sample size (n=...) are excellent and should be retained."
