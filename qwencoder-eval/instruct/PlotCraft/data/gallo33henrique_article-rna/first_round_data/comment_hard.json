    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the following specific actions are recommended:\n\n1.  **Overall Layout and Titles:**\n    *   Rewrite the main title to be more concise, for example: 'Analysis of Scientific Articles on RNA and Proteins'.\n    *   Position this main title centered *above* the entire 2x2 grid, ensuring it does not overlap with any subplot content or titles.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   Redesign the bar chart to be a proper 'grouped' bar chart as requested. For each x-axis category ('Portuguese', 'English'), there should be two distinct bars side-by-side representing 'Unique Titles' and 'Total Articles'.\n    *   The secondary y-axis for 'Cumulative Percentage (%)' has a very narrow range, which exaggerates the line's slope. Consider if this line plot is meaningful with only two categories or if another metric would be better.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   **Crucially, replace the dark, distracting gradient background with a plain white background.** This is essential for readability.\n    *   Implement the requested 'circular layout dendrogram' to show the hierarchical clustering of keywords, combining it with the network graph.\n    *   Resolve the severe overlap of node labels. Use a force-directed layout algorithm (e.g., Fruchterman-Reingold) to better space the nodes, or use a text repulsion library to prevent labels from colliding.\n    *   Ensure the nodes are clearly colored by language as described in the title ('Blue: Portuguese, Purple: English') and are visible against the new white background.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   This plot is the most successful. For a minor enhancement, increase the transparency (reduce alpha) of the individual lines to de-emphasize them and make the overlaid violin plots stand out more clearly.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   **The scatter plot overlay must be fixed.** The data for the scatter plot appears to be improperly scaled, causing all points to cluster in the bottom-left corner. Rescale the x ('text length') and y ('title frequency') axes for the scatter plot so that the points are distributed meaningfully across the entire area of the treemap.\n    *   Ensure the scatter plot points are rendered *on top* of the treemap blocks to be visible.\n    *   Increase the size and add a border to the scatter points to make them more distinct from the treemap background."
