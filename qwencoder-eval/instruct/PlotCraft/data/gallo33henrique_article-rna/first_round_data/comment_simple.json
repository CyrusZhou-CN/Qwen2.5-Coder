Here are the steps to create the correct chart:\n1.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Replace the 2x2 grid with a single (1x1) plot containing a histogram.\n2.  **Data Visualization:** The histogram's data should be the distribution of character counts from the 'Texto' column of the specified dataset. Choose an appropriate number of bins to clearly show the shape of the distribution.\n3.  **Labels and Title:**\n    *   Set a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Distribution of Article Text Lengths'.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Text Length (Number of Characters)'.\n    *   Label the y-axis as 'Frequency' or 'Number of Articles'.\n4.  **Annotations:**\n    *   Calculate the mean of the text lengths.\n    *   Add a vertical line on the histogram at the calculated mean value. Use a distinct color like red to make it stand out.\n    *   Add a text annotation near the vertical line that clearly states the mean value (e.g., 'Mean: 1234.5').\n5.  **Formatting and Professional Standards:**\n    *   Adopt a professional, publication-ready style. Use a white background with black or dark gray text for high readability.\n    *   Make the main title bold and/or slightly larger than the axis labels to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a medium blue or gray) for the histogram bars.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and subtle so they don't distract from the data."
