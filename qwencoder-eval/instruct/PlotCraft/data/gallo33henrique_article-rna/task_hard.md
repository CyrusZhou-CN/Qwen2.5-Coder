## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the scientific article dataset about RNA and proteins. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top-left: Create a grouped bar chart showing the distribution of unique article titles by language (Portuguese vs English), overlaid with a line plot showing the cumulative percentage of articles for each language.

Top-right: Generate a network graph visualization showing the relationships between the most frequent keywords extracted from article texts (minimum 10 occurrences), with nodes sized by frequency and colored by language origin, combined with a circular layout dendrogram showing hierarchical clustering of these keywords.

Bottom-left: Construct a parallel coordinates plot displaying the relationship between article length (character count), title diversity (number of unique titles per language), and text complexity (average sentence length), with each coordinate axis overlaid with violin plots showing the distribution of values.

Bottom-right: Design a treemap showing the hierarchical composition of content themes (extracted from titles and text), combined with a scatter plot overlay where each point represents an article positioned by text length vs title frequency, with points colored by language and sized by content uniqueness score.
