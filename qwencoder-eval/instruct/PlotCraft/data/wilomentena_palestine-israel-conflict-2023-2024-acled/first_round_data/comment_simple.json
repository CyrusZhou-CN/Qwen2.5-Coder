It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. \n\nTo meet the task requirements, a new chart should be created with the following specifications:\n1.  **Chart Type and Layout:** Create a single line chart in a 1x1 layout.\n2.  **Data Representation:** The chart must plot the cumulative number of fatalities in the Palestine-Israel conflict over time.\n3.  **Axes:**\n    *   The x-axis should represent 'Months', covering the period from October 2023 to July 2025.\n    *   The y-axis should represent the 'Cumulative Fatality Count'.\n4.  **Title and Labels:**\n    *   Add a clear and descriptive main title, such as 'Cumulative Fatalities in the Palestine-Israel Conflict (Oct 2023 - Jul 2025)'. The title should be bold and have a larger font size than other text to establish a clear visual hierarchy.\n    *   Label the x-axis as 'Month' and the y-axis as 'Cumulative Fatalities'.\n5.  **Formatting and Professionalism:**\n    *   Use a standard white background for a clean, professional appearance.\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (e.g., dark blue, gray, or black) for the line plot.\n    *   If gridlines are used, they should be thin and light gray to avoid distracting from the data.\n    *   Ensure all text is in a dark, readable color (e.g., black or dark gray) and that there are no overlapping elements."
