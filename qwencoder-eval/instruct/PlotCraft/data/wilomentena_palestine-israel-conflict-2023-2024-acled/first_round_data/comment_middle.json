    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and has no relation to the prompt. It must be discarded and recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n1.  **Start Over:** The entire visualization needs to be re-created based on the actual task prompt concerning the Palestine-Israel conflict data.\n2.  **Correct Layout:** Implement the required 2x2 subplot grid using a function like `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)`.\n3.  **Implement Correct Chart Types:**\n    -   **Subplot (0, 0):** Create a stacked area chart for monthly event types, overlaid with line plots for trends.\n    -   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a combination bar chart (monthly fatalities) and line chart (3-month rolling average), ensuring data is segmented by country as requested.\n    -   **Subplot (1, 0):** Create a dual-axis plot with a histogram of daily event frequencies on one axis and a KDE curve on the other, colored by disorder type.\n    -   **Subplot (1, 1):** Create a time series decomposition plot, showing the raw data as a line and the seasonal component as a filled area. Add annotations for significant peaks.\n4.  **Use Correct Data and Text:** All titles, axis labels, legends, and annotations must be relevant to the Palestine-Israel conflict data as specified in the prompt.\n5.  **Adopt Professional Formatting:**\n    -   Use a standard white background for the entire figure.\n    -   If gridlines are used, make them subtle (e.g., light gray, dashed, thin).\n    -   Establish a clear text hierarchy: make the main figure title larger and/or bolder than the subplot titles.\n    -   Select a professional and harmonious color palette. Avoid harsh, neon colors. Use color meaningfully to distinguish between categories."
