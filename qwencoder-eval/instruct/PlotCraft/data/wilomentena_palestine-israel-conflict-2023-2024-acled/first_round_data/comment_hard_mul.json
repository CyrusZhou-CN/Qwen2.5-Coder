    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is a complete failure to meet the prompt and must be recreated from scratch. The following are fundamental changes required:\n\n1.  **Adhere to Task Requirements:** The primary goal is to follow the prompt. Discard all current charts and data. \n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Implement a dual-axis chart with bars for monthly fatalities and a line for cumulative fatalities.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Create a stacked area chart for event types with trend line overlays.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Generate a proper heatmap of conflict intensity with an overlaid scatter plot sized by fatality counts.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Use grouped bar charts for actor involvement, including trend lines.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 0):** Design dual bar charts for year-over-year comparison with connecting slope lines.\n    *   **Subplot (2, 1):** Create a combined line and scatter plot for escalation patterns.\n\n2.  **Data and Text Content:**\n    *   Use data specifically related to the Palestine-Israel conflict from 2023-2025.\n    *   Replace all nonsensical titles and labels with accurate, descriptive text. For example, 'Random Pie Information' should be 'Monthly and Cumulative Fatalities (2023-2024)'. 'Something' on the x-axis of subplot (1, 1) should be 'Month' or 'Time'.\n\n3.  **Professional Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Background and Colors:** Switch to a standard white background. Replace the neon color palette with a professional, muted, and consistent color scheme suitable for a serious topic. Use color logically to distinguish between categories (e.g., countries, event types) across the dashboard.\n    *   **Clarity and Overlap:** Remove all overlapping text annotations ('OVERLAPPING TEXT', 'MORE TEXT'). Ensure all titles, labels, and legends are placed in clear space and do not obstruct data.\n    *   **Layout and Spacing:** Add a main, bolded title for the entire dashboard (e.g., 'Palestine-Israel Conflict: A Temporal Analysis (2023-2025)'). Significantly increase the horizontal and vertical spacing between subplots to improve readability and visual separation.\n    *   **Visual Hierarchy:** Use font size and weight to create a clear hierarchy. The main title should be largest, followed by subplot titles, and then axis labels and tick marks."
