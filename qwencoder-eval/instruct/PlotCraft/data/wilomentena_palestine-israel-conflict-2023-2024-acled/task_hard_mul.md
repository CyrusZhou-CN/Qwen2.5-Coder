## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis dashboard showing the evolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict from 2023-2025. Design a 3x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques:

Top row (2023-2024 period analysis):
- Subplot 1: Monthly fatality trends with dual-axis showing both total fatalities (bar chart) and cumulative fatalities (line chart overlay), segmented by country
- Subplot 2: Event type evolution over time using stacked area chart with trend lines overlay for each major event type (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Violence against civilians, Protests)

Middle row (Geographic and actor analysis):
- Subplot 3: Heatmap showing monthly conflict intensity by administrative region (admin1) with overlaid scatter points sized by fatality counts
- Subplot 4: Actor involvement timeline using grouped bar charts with trend lines showing the frequency of different primary actors (Military Forces, Hamas, Hezbollah, Protesters) over time

Bottom row (2025 projection and comparative analysis):
- Subplot 5: Comparative monthly event frequency between 2024 and 2025 using dual bar charts with connecting slope lines to show year-over-year changes
- Subplot 6: Conflict escalation patterns using combined line and scatter plot showing the relationship between event frequency and average fatalities per event over time, with different colors for Israel vs Palestine

Each subplot should include appropriate legends, color coding by country/region, and clear temporal markers. Use consistent color schemes across all subplots and ensure proper scaling to highlight both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
