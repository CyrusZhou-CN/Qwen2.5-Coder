## Instruction
Create a line chart showing the temporal evolution of fatalities in the Palestine-Israel conflict from October 2023 to July 2025. Use data from multiple time periods to track how the number of deaths per event has changed over time. Plot the average fatalities per event for each month, with separate lines for events occurring in Israel versus Palestine. Include a trend line or moving average to highlight the overall pattern of violence escalation or de-escalation over this period.
