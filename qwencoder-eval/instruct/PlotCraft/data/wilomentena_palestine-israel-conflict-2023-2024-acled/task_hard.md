## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict from October 2023 to July 2025. Each subplot must be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Row 1 - Event Type Evolution:
- Subplot 1: Stacked area chart showing monthly counts of different event types (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Violence against civilians, etc.) overlaid with a line plot showing total monthly fatalities
- Subplot 2: Dual-axis plot with bar chart showing monthly protest counts and line chart showing the proportion of peaceful vs violent demonstrations
- Subplot 3: Heatmap showing event type distribution by month with overlaid scatter points sized by fatality counts

Row 2 - Geographic and Actor Analysis:
- Subplot 4: Time series line plot showing monthly event counts by country (Israel vs Palestine) with filled area chart showing cumulative fatalities by region
- Subplot 5: Stacked bar chart showing monthly actor involvement (Military Forces, Hamas, Hezbollah, Civilians, etc.) with overlaid line showing civilian targeting incidents
- Subplot 6: Multi-line plot showing temporal trends of different interaction types with shaded confidence intervals

Row 3 - Intensity and Impact Metrics:
- Subplot 7: Combined violin plot and box plot showing monthly fatality distributions overlaid with scatter points for high-casualty events
- Subplot 8: Area chart showing cumulative event counts over time with overlaid step plot showing monthly average fatalities per event
- Subplot 9: Dual-axis visualization with histogram showing event frequency distribution and KDE curve showing fatality density, both segmented by time periods

Each subplot must include proper temporal axis formatting, color-coded legends, and annotations highlighting significant escalation periods. Use consistent color schemes across related metrics and ensure all visualizations effectively demonstrate the conflict's temporal evolution and intensity changes.
