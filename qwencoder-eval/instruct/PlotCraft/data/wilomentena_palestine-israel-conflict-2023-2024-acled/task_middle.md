## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis of the Palestine-Israel conflict data showing how different types of political violence have evolved over time. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques: (1) Top-left: A stacked area chart overlaid with line plots showing the monthly progression of different event types (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Violence against civilians, etc.) with trend lines for each category. (2) Top-right: A combination bar and line chart displaying monthly fatality counts as bars with a rolling 3-month average fatality rate as an overlaid line, segmented by country (Israel vs Palestine). (3) Bottom-left: A dual-axis plot combining a histogram of daily event frequencies with a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve, colored by disorder type (Political violence, Demonstrations, Strategic developments). (4) Bottom-right: A time series decomposition plot showing both the raw monthly event counts as a line chart and seasonal patterns as filled area plots, with annotations marking significant peaks in activity.
