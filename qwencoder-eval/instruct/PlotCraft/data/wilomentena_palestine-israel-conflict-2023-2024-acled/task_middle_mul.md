## Instruction
Create a comprehensive temporal analysis of the Palestine-Israel conflict showing how different types of violence and demonstrations evolved over time from October 2023 to July 2025. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization elements: (1) Top-left: A stacked area chart showing the monthly distribution of event types (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Violence against civilians, Protests, Riots, Strategic developments) overlaid with a line plot showing total monthly fatalities. (2) Top-right: A combination of grouped bar charts showing monthly event counts by country (Israel vs Palestine) with error bars indicating the standard deviation, overlaid with scatter points showing the relationship between event frequency and average fatalities per event. (3) Bottom-left: A dual-axis plot combining a histogram of daily event frequencies with a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve, overlaid with vertical lines marking significant dates and a secondary y-axis showing cumulative fatalities over time. (4) Bottom-right: A heatmap showing the correlation between different disorder types and administrative regions, combined with marginal box plots showing the distribution of fatalities by region and event type.
