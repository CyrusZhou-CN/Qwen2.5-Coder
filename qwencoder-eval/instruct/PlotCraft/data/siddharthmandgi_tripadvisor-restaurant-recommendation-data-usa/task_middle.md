# Visualization Task - Middle

## Category
Ranking

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that ranks restaurants by their review performance across different price ranges. The visualization should consist of two subplots arranged vertically (2x1 grid): 1) Top subplot: Create a horizontal bar chart showing the top 15 restaurants ranked by their average star rating (extract numerical values from the 'Reviews' column), with bars colored by price range categories. 2) Bottom subplot: Create a scatter plot with the number of reviews (x-axis) vs average star rating (y-axis), where point sizes represent the relative ranking position from the top chart, and points are colored by price range. Add trend lines for each price range category to show the relationship between review volume and ratings.
