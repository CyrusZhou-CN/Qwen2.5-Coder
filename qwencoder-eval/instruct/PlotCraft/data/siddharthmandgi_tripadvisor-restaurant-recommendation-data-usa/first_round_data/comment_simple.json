It must be completely redone from scratch.\n\n1.  **Chart Type & Data:** Discard both the pie chart and the horizontal bar chart. Create a single histogram as requested. The x-axis should represent the numeric 'Restaurant Star Ratings', and the y-axis should represent the 'Frequency' or 'Count of Restaurants'.\n2.  **Title and Labels:**\n    *   Change the main title to 'Distribution of Restaurant Star Ratings'.\n    *   Set the x-axis label to 'Star Rating'.\n    *   Set the y-axis label to 'Number of Restaurants'.\n    *   Remove the nonsensical legend ('Glarbnok's Revenge').\n3.  **Color and Formatting:**\n    *   Use a single, neutral color (e.g., a medium blue or gray) for the histogram bars.\n    *   Switch to a professional format: a white background with subtle, light-gray gridlines on the y-axis only (or no gridlines at all).\n    *   Ensure the title is bold and has a slightly larger font size than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n4.  **Layout:** Use a standard 1x1 plot layout with balanced spacing and margins. Ensure all text elements (title, labels, tick marks) are clearly visible and do not overlap."
