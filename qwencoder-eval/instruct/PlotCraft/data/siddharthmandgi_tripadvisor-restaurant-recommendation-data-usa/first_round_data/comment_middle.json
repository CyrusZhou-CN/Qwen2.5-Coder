    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Color Encoding**: The most critical issue is the color mapping. The legend and colors should represent *only* the 'Price Range' categories (e.g., Budget, Mid-Range, Expensive) as requested in the prompt. Remove cuisine types ('American', 'Italian') from the color encoding for both subplots.\n2. **Address Overplotting in Scatter Plot**: In subplot (1, 0), the severe overplotting must be addressed. Apply a high level of transparency (alpha) to the points to reveal density. Additionally, apply a small amount of vertical 'jitter' to the points to separate them visually without distorting the y-axis values significantly.\n3. **Enhance Trend Lines**: In subplot (1, 0), the trend lines are barely visible. Make them thicker, use solid lines instead of dashed, and ensure the legend is updated to show which line corresponds to which price range category.\n4. **Fix Data Duplication**: In subplot (0, 0), remove the duplicate entry for 'Fiore Deli of Hoboken' to ensure the chart displays 15 unique restaurants.\n5. **Improve Legend Placement**: Move the legends for both subplots outside the main plot area (e.g., to the right) to prevent them from obscuring any data points.\n6. **De-clutter Bar Chart**: In subplot (0, 0), the data labels on the bars (all '5.0') are redundant since the x-axis already provides this information. Remove these labels to create a cleaner look.\n7. **Refine Color Palette**: Select a color palette with more distinct hues for the price range categories to improve differentiability, especially in the dense scatter plot."
