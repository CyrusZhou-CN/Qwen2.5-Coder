## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x3 subplot grid analyzing restaurant clustering patterns across different dimensions. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row: (1) Scatter plot with density contours showing the relationship between review count and star ratings, colored by price range, with marginal histograms; (2) Grouped violin plots showing the distribution of review counts across different price ranges, overlaid with box plots; (3) Stacked bar chart showing cuisine type composition by state, with a secondary line plot showing average ratings per state.

Middle row: (4) Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of restaurants based on their characteristics (ratings, review counts, price range), with a heatmap showing the distance matrix; (5) Network graph showing connections between restaurants that share similar cuisine types and are in the same price range, with node sizes representing review counts; (6) Parallel coordinates plot showing multi-dimensional restaurant profiles across ratings, review counts, price range (encoded numerically), and cuisine diversity.

Bottom row: (7) Treemap showing restaurant distribution by state and city hierarchy, with cell sizes representing review counts and colors representing average ratings; (8) Radar chart comparison of top 5 most reviewed restaurants across multiple normalized metrics (ratings, review counts, price level), overlaid with area fills; (9) Cluster scatter plot using dimensionality reduction (PCA) on restaurant features, with different colors for natural clusters identified through k-means, including cluster centroids and confidence ellipses.
