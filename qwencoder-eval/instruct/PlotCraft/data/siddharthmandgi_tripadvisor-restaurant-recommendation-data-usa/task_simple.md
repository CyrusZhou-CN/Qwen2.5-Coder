# Visualization Task - Simple

## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of restaurant star ratings across all restaurants in the dataset. Extract the numeric rating values from the 'Reviews' column (e.g., "4.5 of 5 bubbles" should be extracted as 4.5) and create a histogram with appropriate bins to visualize how restaurant ratings are distributed. Include proper axis labels, a title, and ensure the histogram clearly shows the frequency of each rating level.
