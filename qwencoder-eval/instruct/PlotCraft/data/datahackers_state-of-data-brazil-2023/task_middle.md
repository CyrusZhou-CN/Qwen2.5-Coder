Distribution

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive salary distribution analysis for data professionals in Brazil. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization techniques:

Top-left: Create a histogram with overlaid KDE curve showing the distribution of salary ranges ('P2_h') across all respondents, with different colors for each experience level ('P2_i').

Top-right: Generate a violin plot combined with box plot overlay showing salary distribution by professional role/position ('P2_f'), rotating x-axis labels for readability.

Bottom-left: Develop a ridge plot (joy plot) displaying salary distributions segmented by education level ('P1_l'), with each education level shown as a separate density curve stacked vertically.

Bottom-right: Construct a population pyramid-style chart showing salary distribution split by gender ('P1_b'), with males on one side and females on the other, using horizontal bar charts with different colors.

Include proper titles, axis labels, and a legend. Handle missing values appropriately and ensure all salary ranges are properly ordered from lowest to highest income brackets.
