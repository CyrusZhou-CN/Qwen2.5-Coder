    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, focus on both task compliance and visual refinement:\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Fixes:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Implement bubble sizing based on salary ranges and add a corresponding size legend to clarify the encoding.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Add the missing 'area of formation' axis to the parallel coordinates plot. The line plot overlay should be recalculated to represent the count of professionals for each unique path (combination of categories), not just a single value per axis.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** The most critical missing feature is the network aspect. Add lines connecting data points that represent professionals with similar technology stacks (e.g., same programming language and cloud platform).\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Replace the horizontal bar chart with a proper hierarchical visualization like a dendrogram or a treemap that incorporates both 'sectors' and 'company sizes'. The correlation heatmap should be integrated with this structure as requested, not as a simple inset.\n\n2.  **Layout and Clarity Adjustments:**\n    *   **Main Title:** The highest priority fix is the main title. Use a function like `suptitle` and adjust its vertical position (e.g., `y=1.02`) to place it cleanly above all subplots, eliminating the current overlap.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0) Legend:** Ensure the legend text is not truncated. If necessary, resize the plot area or the legend box to accommodate the full text.\n\n3.  **Text and Formatting Enhancements:**\n    *   **Main Title Text:** Rephrase the main title for better readability, for example: 'Brazil's Data Professional Landscape: An Analysis of Clustering and Hierarchy'.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** In subplot (1,0), ensure the rotated x-axis labels have enough padding from the axis.\n\n4.  **Color Scheme Refinements:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Reduce the visual weight of the red overlay line. Either choose a less saturated color or decrease its opacity to prevent it from overpowering the parallel coordinates data."
