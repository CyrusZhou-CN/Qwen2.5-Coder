    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is a complete failure and needs to be recreated from scratch. The following steps should be taken:\n\n1.  **Layout and Structure:**\n    *   Create a 2x2 subplot grid using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(2, 2)`.\n    *   Add a main figure title, such as 'Salary Distribution for Data Professionals in Brazil', to provide overall context.\n\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   Replace the scatter plot with a histogram combined with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve using a library like Seaborn (`seaborn.histplot` with `kde=True`).\n    *   Use the `hue` parameter to create different colored distributions for each experience level.\n    *   Set the title to 'Salary Distribution by Experience Level'.\n    *   Label the x-axis 'Salary Range' and the y-axis 'Frequency' or 'Density'.\n\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   Replace the pie chart with a violin plot that has a box plot overlay (`seaborn.violinplot` with `inner='box'`).\n    *   Plot salary distribution against professional roles.\n    *   Set the title to 'Salary Distribution by Professional Role'.\n    *   Label the y-axis 'Salary Range' and the x-axis 'Professional Role'.\n    *   Rotate the x-axis tick labels by 45 degrees to prevent overlap.\n\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   Replace the horizontal bar chart with a ridge plot (joy plot) to show salary distributions for each education level. This can be achieved using libraries like `joypy` or by creating stacked KDE plots.\n    *   Set the title to 'Salary Distribution by Education Level'.\n    *   Ensure each density curve is clearly labeled with the corresponding education level.\n\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   Create the missing fourth subplot.\n    *   Implement a population pyramid using two back-to-back horizontal bar charts to compare salary distributions by gender. One gender's data should be plotted with negative values to appear on the left.\n    *   Set the title to 'Salary Distribution by Gender'.\n    *   Label the central y-axis 'Salary Range' and the x-axis 'Number of Respondents'.\n\n6.  **General Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   Use a professional and consistent color palette across all subplots. Avoid neon and overly saturated colors.\n    *   Set the background of the entire figure and all subplots to white.\n    *   Use subtle, light gray gridlines where necessary.\n    *   Ensure all text is legible, correctly spelled, and relevant to the data.\n    *   Use `plt.tight_layout()` to automatically adjust subplot parameters for a clean layout."
