    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart is fundamentally incorrect and needs to be completely redone. A simple revision is not possible.\n\n1.  **Data and Content Correction:** The primary issue is the data itself. The chart must be regenerated using the correct dataset for the ages of data professionals in Brazil.\n2.  **Layout and Chart Type:** Create a single (1x1) histogram. The second scatter plot (subplot (1, 0)) is irrelevant and must be removed entirely.\n3.  **Text Content:**\n    *   **Main Title:** Change the title to something accurate, such as 'Distribution of Ages of Data Professionals in Brazil'.\n    *   **Axis Labels:** The x-axis label should be 'Age', and the y-axis label should be 'Frequency' or 'Count'.\n    *   **Tick Labels:** Add numerical tick labels to both the x-axis (showing age ranges or specific ages) and the y-axis (showing counts) to make the chart interpretable.\n    *   **Annotations:** Remove the incorrect text boxes for temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Calculate the actual mean, median, and standard deviation of the age data and display them in a single, clean text box in the top-right corner of the plot. Use a standard black font without a colored background or border.\n4.  **Formatting and Aesthetics:**\n    *   **Borders:** Remove the thick, bright orange borders around the figure and the plot area. Use standard, thin, black or dark gray axis lines (spines).\n    *   **Color Scheme:** Use a single, professional color (e.g., a muted blue or steel gray) for the histogram bars. The color for the scatter plot is irrelevant as the plot should be removed.\n    *   **Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure the main title is bold and has a larger font size than the axis labels to establish a clear hierarchy."
