## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing the clustering patterns and hierarchical relationships within Brazil's data professional landscape. Each subplot should be a composite visualization:

Top-left: Create a scatter plot with bubble sizes representing salary ranges, where x-axis shows years of experience in data ('P2_i'), y-axis shows age ('P1_a'), and colors represent different roles ('P2_f'). Overlay this with a KDE contour plot to show density patterns of professionals.

Top-right: Develop a parallel coordinates plot showing the relationship between education level ('P1_l'), area of formation ('P1_m'), current role ('P2_f'), and seniority level ('P2_g'). Add a secondary line plot overlay showing the count of professionals in each category combination.

Bottom-left: Construct a network-style visualization using a scatter plot where each point represents a professional, positioned by their primary programming language ('P4_e') on x-axis and preferred cloud platform ('P4_i') on y-axis. Use different colors for work arrangement preferences ('P2_s') and add connecting lines between professionals with similar technology stacks.

Bottom-right: Create a hierarchical clustering visualization combining a dendrogram-style bar chart showing the distribution of professionals across different sectors ('P2_b') and company sizes ('P2_c'), overlaid with a heatmap showing the correlation matrix between satisfaction levels ('P2_k'), salary ranges ('P2_h'), and work arrangement satisfaction.
