## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid visualization analyzing the temporal and spatial changes in deep-sea microbiome composition and metabolic activity across different sediment depths and trench positions. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots): Analyze microbiome composition changes over depth
- Subplot 1: Create a stacked area chart showing the relative abundance of major phyla (Proteobacteria, Chloroflexota, Thaumarchaeota, Planctomycetota) across sediment depths (0-21 cmbsf), overlaid with a line plot showing the Microbiome Novelty Score (MNS) trend
- Subplot 2: Generate a dual-axis plot with bars showing novel 16S miTag percentages and a line plot displaying water depth variations across different sampling sites, colored by trench position (Slope vs Bottom)
- Subplot 3: Construct a combination chart with stacked bars representing CAZyme gene categories (GT, GH, CE, AA, PL, CBM) by phylum, overlaid with scatter points showing the CAZyme rate per genome

Bottom row (3 subplots): Examine metabolic pathway expression changes
- Subplot 4: Design a heatmap-line combination showing metabolic gene expression (TPM values) for key pathways (Glycolysis, TCA cycle, Acetate metabolism) across different samples, with overlaid trend lines for each pathway
- Subplot 5: Create a multi-layer visualization combining violin plots showing the distribution of genome sizes by trench position, overlaid with box plots and individual MAG abundance scatter points across sediment core samples
- Subplot 6: Develop a temporal series plot showing MAG cluster abundance changes across three depth intervals (T3L11 samples at 6-9, 12-15, 18-21 cmbsf), with separate trend lines for different phylogenetic groups and error bands

Use consistent color schemes across subplots, include proper legends, axis labels, and ensure each composite visualization effectively demonstrates how deep-sea microbiome communities and their metabolic capabilities change with sediment depth, spatial position, and environmental gradients in the Challenger Deep.
