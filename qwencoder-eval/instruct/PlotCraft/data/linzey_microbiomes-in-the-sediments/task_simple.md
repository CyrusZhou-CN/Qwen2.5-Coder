## Category
Distribution

## Instruction
Create a histogram showing the distribution of CAZyme rates across different microbial phyla from deep-sea sediment genomes. Use the CAZyme rate data to construct a histogram with appropriate bins (8-10 bins) and overlay density curves for each major phylum (those with at least 10 genomes). Color-code the histogram bars by phylum and add a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve for the overall distribution. Include proper axis labels, a legend, and ensure the plot clearly shows how CAZyme enzymatic potential varies across different microbial lineages in the deep-sea environment.
