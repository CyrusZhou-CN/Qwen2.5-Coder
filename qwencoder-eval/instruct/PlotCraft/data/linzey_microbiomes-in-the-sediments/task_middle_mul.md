## Instruction
Create a comprehensive visualization showing the temporal evolution of microbial community composition and metabolic activity in deep-sea sediments across different depths. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where: (1) Top-left: A stacked area chart showing the relative abundance changes of major microbial phyla over sediment depth (cmbsf) for the deepest trench samples (T3L11 series), (2) Top-right: A line plot with multiple lines showing the abundance trends of key metabolic genes (glk, pckA, CS) across the same depth gradient, (3) Bottom-left: A heatmap displaying the distribution patterns of CAZyme functional categories (GT, GH, CE, AA, PL, CBM) across different microbial phyla, and (4) Bottom-right: A scatter plot with trend lines showing the relationship between sediment depth and microbiome novelty scores (MNS), with points colored by trench position (Slope vs Bottom). Use consistent color schemes across subplots and include proper legends, axis labels, and subplot titles that highlight the temporal changes in deep-sea microbial ecosystems.
