# Visualization Task - Simple

## Instruction
Create a comprehensive visualization showing how microbial community composition changes with sediment depth across different trench positions. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot contains both stacked area charts and line plots overlaid together. The top row should compare slope vs. bottom positions, while the bottom row should show temporal changes in the deepest samples. Each subplot should display: (1) a stacked area chart showing the relative abundance of the top 8 most abundant phyla over depth/time, and (2) overlaid line plots showing the trends of 3-4 key individual phyla. Use the taxonomic data from Supplementary Fig.3.csv for phylum abundances and Fig.1bc.csv for sample metadata including depth and position information. Color-code the areas and lines consistently across all subplots, add depth markers on x-axes, and include legends that clearly distinguish between the stacked areas and individual trend lines.
