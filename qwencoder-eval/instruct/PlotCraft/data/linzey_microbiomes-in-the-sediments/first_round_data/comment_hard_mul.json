    "improvement_suggestions": "To enhance the chart's quality and compliance, the following specific improvements are recommended:\n\n1.  **Correct MNS Trend Visualization (Subplot (0, 0)):** Replace the current 'spaghetti plot' of multiple MNS lines with a single, clear trend line. This can be achieved by plotting a moving average or a LOESS regression line. Also, consider adding a shaded confidence interval around the trend line to represent variability. This will fulfill the prompt's requirement and drastically improve clarity.\n\n2.  **Enforce Color Consistency:** Establish a consistent color palette for categorical variables across the entire figure. For instance, consistently use salmon for 'Slope' and light blue for 'Bottom-axis' in both subplot (0, 1) and subplot (1, 1). This is critical for accurate interpretation.\n\n3.  **Resolve X-Axis Label Overlap:**\n    *   In subplots (0, 1) and (1, 0), shorten the sample names on the x-axis or increase the figure's width to allow for horizontal label placement without overlap.\n    *   In subplot (0, 2), the x-axis labels ('Phylum') are long and rotated. Widen the plot to allow these labels to be displayed horizontally.\n\n4.  **Improve Subplot (1, 2) Readability:** In the 'Temporal MAG Cluster Changes' plot, replace the current muted color palette (brown, grey, green) with a set of more distinct and vibrant colors to make it easier to differentiate between the phylogenetic groups.\n\n5.  **Refine Titles and Legends:**\n    *   Remove the redundant and misaligned 'Sampling Sites' text above the main title in subplot (1, 0).\n    *   In subplot (0, 1), simplify the legend for 'Water Depth' to be a simple black line segment next to the label, which is more conventional than the current box representation.\n\n6.  **Adjust Layout Spacing:** Slightly increase the whitespace between subplots (both `wspace` and `hspace`) to reduce the overall cramped feeling and provide more room for axis labels and titles, leading to a cleaner and more professional presentation."
