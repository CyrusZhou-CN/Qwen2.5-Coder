    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, focus on fixing task compliance issues and refining the layout and text for clarity.\n\n1.  **Task Compliance Corrections:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Add the required marginal histograms along the top and right axes of the scatter plot to show the distributions of 'Genome Size' and 'CAZyme Rate'.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** Add the hierarchical clustering dendrogram to the x-axis (top) of the heatmap to show how the samples are grouped.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 0):** Correct the title to 'Gene Correlation Network (|r| > 0.7)' to match the specified correlation threshold.\n    *   **Subplot (1, 1):** Overlay box plots within the violins and add a swarm plot of individual data points on top of the violin plots.\n\n2.  **Layout and Spacing Adjustments:**\n    *   Use a constrained layout function (e.g., `plt.tight_layout()` or `fig.subplots_adjust()`) to automatically fix the major overlap and spacing issues. This will resolve the overlap between the legend of (0,0) and the plot area of (0,1) and reduce the large vertical gap between the rows.\n    *   Adjust the aspect ratio of the subplots to be more uniform. Specifically, increase the size of the network plot (1,0) to better utilize the available space and match the scale of the other plots.\n\n3.  **Text Formatting and Clarity:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** Move the legend to a position outside the plot area (e.g., to the right of the entire 2x2 grid) to prevent any overlap and ensure all labels are fully visible. Alternatively, reduce the legend's font size.\n    *   **Subplot (0, 1):** For the x-axis labels, rotate them 45 degrees and set horizontal alignment to 'right' to prevent them from overlapping. For the y-axis labels, reduce the font size slightly so they are not truncated.\n    *   **Titles:** Apply a consistent style to all subplot titles (e.g., same font size and bold weight) for a cohesive visual hierarchy.\n\n4.  **Color Scheme Enhancements:**\n    *   **Subplot (0, 0):** The number of categories (phyla) is very high. Consider using a color palette designed for many categories (like `tab20` or `tab20b` in Matplotlib) or grouping less frequent phyla into an 'Other' category to make the legend more manageable and the colors more distinct."
