    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Resolve Title Overlap**: Increase the vertical spacing between the main title and the grid of subplots to eliminate the overlap. This can be achieved by adjusting the top margin of the subplot layout (e.g., using `plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)`).\n2. **Improve Layout Balance**: Relocate the 'Dataset Summary' and 'Legend' boxes. Place the 'Phylum Colors' legend in the empty cell at subplot (3, 2) and the combined 'Dataset Summary' and line/bar 'Legend' into the empty cell at subplot (3, 3). This will create a more balanced and organized layout.\n3. **Correct Legend Text**: In the legend text box, change the description from 'Black line: Overall distribution KDE' to 'Gray line: Overall distribution KDE' to accurately match the chart's visual elements.\n4. **Enhance Title Hierarchy**: After resolving the overlap, consider slightly increasing the font size of the main title to further distinguish it from the subplot titles and solidify the visual hierarchy."
