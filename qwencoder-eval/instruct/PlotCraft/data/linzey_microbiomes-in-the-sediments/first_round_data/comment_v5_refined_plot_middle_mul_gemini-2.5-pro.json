    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant revisions to be considered professional. Here are specific suggestions:\n1.  **Main Title:** This is the most critical issue. There are two overlapping titles. Remove them and replace with a single, clear, and centered main title for the entire figure, such as 'Microbial Community Composition and Metabolic Activity in Deep-Sea Sediments'. Ensure there is adequate padding between the title and the top subplots.\n2.  **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the vertical space between the rows of subplots to prevent the titles of the bottom plots from crowding the x-axes of the top plots. This can be achieved using a function like `tight_layout()` with padding or `subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)`.\n3.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Heatmap:**\n    *   **Axis Label Position:** Move the y-axis label 'Microbial Phyla' further to the left to eliminate the overlap with the tick labels.\n    *   **Tick Label Coloring:** The color-coding of y-tick labels needs to be fixed or removed. If kept, ensure every phylum that also appears in the subplot (0, 0) legend is colored consistently. Crucially, select colors with high contrast against the white background for readability; for example, use a darker purple for 'Patescibacteria' or make the text bold.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Scatter Plot:**\n    *   **Axis Label Clarity:** The x-axis is labeled 'Depth (m)', which could be confused with the 'Sediment Depth (cmbsf)' in the top plots. To improve clarity, consider relabeling it to 'Water Column Depth (m)' if that is what the data represents.\n5.  **Typographic Hierarchy:** Establish a clear and consistent font hierarchy. The main title should be the largest and boldest. Subplot titles should be smaller but still prominent (e.g., bold). Axis labels and other text should be smaller still but perfectly legible."
