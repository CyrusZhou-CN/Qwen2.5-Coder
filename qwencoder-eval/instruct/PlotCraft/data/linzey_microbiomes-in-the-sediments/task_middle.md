## Instruction
Create a comprehensive visualization showing the temporal evolution of microbial community composition across different sediment depths in the Challenger Deep. Design a 2x2 subplot grid where each subplot combines multiple visualization types: (1) Top-left: A stacked area chart overlaid with line plots showing the relative abundance changes of the top 5 most abundant phyla across sediment depths (0-21 cmbsf) for sample T3L11, with individual line plots for each phylum trend; (2) Top-right: A combination bar chart with error bars showing CAZyme gene counts per phylum, overlaid with a scatter plot showing the relationship between genome size and CAZyme density; (3) Bottom-left: A dual-axis plot combining a heatmap showing gene expression levels (TPM) for key metabolic pathways across different depths, with a line plot overlay showing the microbiome novelty scores (MNS) trend; (4) Bottom-right: A composite chart showing both a violin plot of novel 16S miTag rates distribution by trench position (slope vs bottom) and a connected scatter plot showing the depth-dependent changes in community structure over the 0-21 cmbsf gradient.
