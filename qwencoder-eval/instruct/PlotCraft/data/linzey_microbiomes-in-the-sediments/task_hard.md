## Instruction
Create a complex 2x2 subplot grid analyzing microbial community clustering and functional gene expression patterns in deep-sea sediments. Each subplot should be a composite visualization:

Top-left: Create a scatter plot with marginal histograms showing the relationship between genome size (x-axis) and CAZyme rate (y-axis) from the MAG data, with points colored by phylum and sized by CAZyme count. Add marginal distribution plots for both variables.

Top-right: Generate a clustered heatmap showing the relative abundance of the top 15 most abundant microbial genomes across all sediment samples, with hierarchical clustering dendrograms on both axes. Include a color bar legend and cluster the data to reveal sample groupings.

Bottom-left: Create a network-style correlation plot showing the relationships between key metabolic genes (from the pathway analysis data), where nodes represent genes and edges represent correlations above 0.7. Color nodes by metabolic pathway and size them by average expression level.

Bottom-right: Produce a grouped violin plot overlaid with box plots showing the distribution of gene expression levels (TPM values) for the top 10 most highly expressed genes, grouped by sediment depth categories (0-10cm, 10-20cm, >20cm). Include individual data points as a swarm plot overlay.
