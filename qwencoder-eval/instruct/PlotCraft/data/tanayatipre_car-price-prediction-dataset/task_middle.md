## Category
Correlation

## Instruction
Create a composite visualization that explores the relationship between income and employment characteristics. Design a 1x2 subplot layout where the left plot shows a scatter plot of Income vs Employment length (converted to positive years) with points colored by Employment status, and the right plot displays a correlation heatmap showing the relationships between Income, Employment length, Age (converted to positive years), and Family member count. Add trend lines to the scatter plot and ensure proper axis labels and legends for both visualizations.
