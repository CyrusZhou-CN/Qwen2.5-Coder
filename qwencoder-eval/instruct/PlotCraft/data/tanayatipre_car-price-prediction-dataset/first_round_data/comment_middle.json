    "improvement_suggestions": "The chart requires significant layout adjustments to become readable and professional. \n1. **Overall Layout & Spacing:** Increase the vertical height of the figure to give the plots a more balanced aspect ratio. Use a function like `plt.tight_layout(pad=3.0)` or `fig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.4)` to introduce significant horizontal space between the two subplots. This will prevent elements from overlapping and being cut off.\n2. **Titles:** Replace the single, combined title with separate, specific titles for each subplot. For subplot (0, 0), use a title like 'Income vs. Employment Length by Status'. For subplot (0, 1), use 'Correlation Matrix of Key Variables'. Make titles bold to improve visual hierarchy.\n3. **Subplot (0, 0) - Scatter Plot:**\n   - **Aspect Ratio:** Widen this subplot to prevent the data from being compressed vertically. This will make the trend and distribution of points much clearer.\n   - **Legend:** Move the legend to a non-overlapping position, such as the 'upper right' corner within the plot's axes, or place it outside the plot entirely. Ensure the legend has a title ('Employment Status').\n4. **Subplot (0, 1) - Heatmap:**\n   - **Label Visibility:** The layout adjustments should fix the issue of the y-axis labels being cut off. Ensure they are fully rendered.\n   - **Colorbar:** Add a descriptive label to the colorbar, such as 'Correlation Coefficient', to clarify what the colors represent.\n5. **Axis Labels:** The x-axis of the scatter plot shows large numbers for 'Employment length'. The prompt specified 'converted to positive years'. Verify the data units and update the axis label accordingly (e.g., 'Employment Length (days)' or 'Employment Length (years)') for clarity."
