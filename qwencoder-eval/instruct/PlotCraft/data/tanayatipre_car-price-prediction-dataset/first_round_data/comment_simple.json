    "improvement_suggestions": "The generated chart is fundamentally incorrect and cannot be salvaged. It must be recreated from scratch. \n1. **Start Over:** Discard the current bar and pie charts entirely.\n2. **Correct Chart Type:** Use a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'income' variable. The x-axis should represent income ranges (bins), and the y-axis should represent the frequency (count of people).\n3. **Implement Bin Requirement:** Ensure the histogram is created with exactly 15 bins as specified in the prompt.\n4. **Correct Text Content:**\n   - **Title:** Change the title to something clear and descriptive, such as 'Distribution of Income Levels'.\n   - **X-Axis Label:** Label the x-axis as 'Income'.\n   - **Y-Axis Label:** Label the y-axis as 'Number of Individuals' or 'Frequency'.\n5. **Professional Formatting:**\n   - Use a clean, professional style with a white background.\n   - If gridlines are used, they should be light gray and subtle.\n   - Ensure the title is bolded and slightly larger than the axis labels to create a clear visual hierarchy.\n   - Choose a single, professional color for the histogram bars (e.g., a muted blue or gray) instead of the current harsh colors."
