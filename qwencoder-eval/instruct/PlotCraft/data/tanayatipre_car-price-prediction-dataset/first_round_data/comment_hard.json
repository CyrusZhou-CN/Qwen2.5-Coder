    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this visualization, several critical changes are needed:\n1.  **Layout and Spacing:** Increase the vertical spacing (`hspace`) between subplot rows significantly to prevent titles from overlapping with the charts above them. A value of `hspace=0.5` or higher in a tool like Matplotlib would be a good starting point.\n2.  **Complete Missing Visualizations:**\n    *   **Subplot (0,1):** Re-create this as a `seaborn.jointplot` with `kind='kde'` or `kind='hex'` to include the required scatter plot, density contours, and marginal histograms.\n    *   **Subplot (0,2):** Change the bar chart to a stacked bar chart to show the composition of families. Correct the secondary y-axis by moving its label to the right side to avoid overlap.\n    *   **Subplot (1,0):** Use `seaborn.clustermap` to generate the heatmap, which will automatically include the required hierarchical clustering dendrograms. Ensure x-axis labels are rotated (e.g., 45 degrees) and fully visible by adjusting the plot margins.\n    *   **Subplot (1,2):** The 'connecting flow lines' are complex; this might be better represented as a Sankey diagram or require a custom drawing solution to connect the nested pie segments.\n    *   **Subplot (2,1):** Add density bands to the parallel coordinates plot. Increase the `alpha` and `linewidth` of the 'High Risk' (red) lines to make them clearly distinguishable from the 'Low Risk' (blue) lines.\n    *   **Subplot (2,2):** Populate this subplot with the bubble plot and trend line as requested in the prompt. The axes are present, but the data is missing.\n3.  **Text and Formatting:**\n    *   **Consistency:** Apply a consistent, professional theme to all subplots: white background, subtle light-gray gridlines, and black axis lines/text.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** Make all subplot titles bold and a consistent font size (e.g., 12pt). Use a slightly smaller, non-bold font for axis labels (e.g., 10pt).\n    *   **Labels:** In subplot (1,0), remove the trailing hyphens from the y-axis tick labels (e.g., 'Academic degree' instead of 'Academic degree -')."
