    "improvement_suggestions": "To improve this chart, the following specific changes are recommended:\n\n**Overall Figure:**\n1.  Add a main, bolded title for the entire figure, such as 'Smartphone Company Stock Performance Analysis (2016-2021)'.\n2.  Add an 'Year' or 'Date' label to the x-axis of all four subplots.\n\n**Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n1.  **Data Correction:** Replace the data for 'ZTE' and 'VIVO' with the requested data for 'Apple' and 'Google Pixel'.\n2.  **Y-Axis Correction:** Completely reformat the secondary y-axis to eliminate the severe overlap of tick labels. Ensure both primary and secondary axes are clearly legible. Add axis labels: 'Closing Price' for the primary and '30-Day Moving Average' for the secondary.\n3.  **Legend:** Update the legend to reflect the correct companies. Add entries for the moving average lines, for example: 'Apple (MA-30)', 'Samsung (MA-30)', etc.\n\n**Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n1.  **Axis Labels:** Add a y-axis label, such as 'Cumulative Percentage Return (%)'.\n\n**Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n1.  **Data Representation:** The plot must be changed to show data for 'Lenovo', 'Vivo', and 'ZTE' individually. This could be done with grouped bar charts for volume and three separate colored lines for volatility.\n2.  **Legend:** Update the legend to identify which color/style corresponds to which company for both volume and volatility.\n3.  **Axis Labels:** Add a y-axis label, such as 'Monthly Average Volume'. If volatility is plotted on a different scale, a secondary y-axis labeled 'Price Volatility (Std. Dev.)' should be added.\n\n**Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n1.  **Dual-Axis Implementation:** This plot MUST use a secondary y-axis. Plot the 'Closing Price' line on the primary y-axis and the 'Volume' area chart on a secondary y-axis. This will allow the variations in the closing price to be visible instead of being flattened to zero.\n2.  **Axis Labels:** Add a label for the primary y-axis ('Closing Price') and the secondary y-axis ('Trading Volume').\n3.  **Title/Legend:** Update the title or legend to specify that the data is for 'Alcatel Lucent'."
