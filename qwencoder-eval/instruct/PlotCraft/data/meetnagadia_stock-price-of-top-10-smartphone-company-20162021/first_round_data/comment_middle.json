Here are the steps to create the correct visualization:\n\n1.  **Layout:** Create a 2x2 subplot grid.\n2.  **Subplot (0, 0) - Top-Left:**\n    *   Plot closing prices for Apple, Samsung, and Google using line charts on the primary y-axis.\n    *   Create a secondary y-axis and plot their respective trading volumes using area charts.\n    *   Label the axes correctly (e.g., 'Date', 'Closing Price', 'Trading Volume').\n    *   Use a clear legend to differentiate the companies and metrics.\n3.  **Subplot (0, 1) - Top-Right:**\n    *   Generate combined violin plots and box plots for the daily price change distribution of the 10 specified companies.\n    *   Label the x-axis with company names and the y-axis with 'Daily Price Change (%)'.\n4.  **Subplot (1, 0) - Bottom-Left:**\n    *   Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix for monthly average closing prices.\n    *   Label both axes with the company names.\n    *   Include a color bar labeled 'Correlation Coefficient' to show the strength of the correlation.\n5.  **Subplot (1, 1) - Bottom-Right:**\n    *   Use stacked area charts to show the cumulative percentage returns for the top 5 companies, normalized to 100.\n    *   Overlay scatter points to mark days with >5% price changes.\n    *   Label axes appropriately ('Date', 'Cumulative Return (Normalized)').\n6.  **General Formatting:**\n    *   **Color:** Replace the neon palette with a professional, harmonious color scheme (e.g., using blues, greens, and grays).\n    *   **Background & Grid:** Use a white background for the entire figure and light gray, non-distracting gridlines for the plots.\n    *   **Text:** Ensure all titles, labels, and annotations are correct, informative, and properly spelled. Use a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., bold main title, regular subplot titles).\n    *   **Spacing:** Adjust subplot spacing to ensure no elements overlap and the overall layout is balanced and readable."
