    "improvement_suggestions": "1. **Correct Task Compliance Errors:**\n   - **Layout:** Re-create the figure with the specified 3x2 grid, ensuring the bottom row has only two subplots.\n   - **Data:** Use the correct company data for each subplot: (0, 1) should be Nokia, LG, Xiaomi; (0, 2) should be Lenovo, Vivo, ZTE; the bottom row plots should include data from all specified companies.\n   - **Chart Type:** Combine the heatmap and box plots into a single subplot as requested, with the box plots serving as marginal distributions along the top and/or right axes of the heatmap.\n\n2. **Enhance Color and Consistency:**\n   - **Unified Palette:** Assign a unique and consistent color to each company and use it across all subplots where that company appears. For example, Apple should always be blue, Samsung always orange, etc. This is critical for a dashboard.\n   - **Improve Readability:** In subplot (1, 0), change the colors of the two moving average lines to be more distinct (e.g., red and purple). Make the volume bars a darker, more visible color.\n\n3. **Improve Text and Label Clarity:**\n   - **Fix Overlapping Labels:** In subplot (0, 2), resolve the unreadable x-axis labels. Either show fewer labels (e.g., one per year) or use a smaller font and adjust the rotation and alignment to prevent overlap.\n   - **Hierarchy and Spacing:** Add a main figure title (`suptitle`) to provide overall context. Increase the vertical spacing between subplot rows (`hspace`) so that subplot titles do not crowd the charts above them.\n\n4. **Refine Layout and Formatting:**\n   - **Professional Polish:** Adjust font sizes to create a clearer visual hierarchy (e.g., main title > subplot titles > axis labels > tick labels). Ensure consistent font usage throughout.\n   - **Element Spacing:** Add padding around the color bar in the heatmap subplot to give it breathing room from adjacent elements."
