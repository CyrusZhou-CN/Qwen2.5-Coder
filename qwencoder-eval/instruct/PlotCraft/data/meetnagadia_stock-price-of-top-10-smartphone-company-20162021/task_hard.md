- Subplot 2: Google Pixel vs Xiaomi - Line chart of closing prices with overlaid volume bars (secondary y-axis) and trend lines
- Subplot 3: Nokia vs LG - Line chart of normalized closing prices (starting at 100) with overlaid RSI indicator as area chart

Row 2: Volatility and Performance Comparison
- Subplot 4: Top 5 companies by market cap - Candlestick charts showing monthly OHLC data with overlaid Bollinger Bands
- Subplot 5: All companies - Box plots of daily returns grouped by year with overlaid violin plots showing distribution density
- Subplot 6: Lenovo vs ZTE vs Alcatel - Line chart of cumulative returns with overlaid drawdown area charts (filled negative areas)

Row 3: Advanced Temporal Patterns
- Subplot 7: Seasonal analysis - Heatmap showing average monthly returns for all companies with overlaid line plot of overall market trend
- Subplot 8: Correlation evolution - Time-series line chart showing rolling 90-day correlation coefficients between Apple-Samsung, Google-Xiaomi, and Nokia-LG pairs
- Subplot 9: Risk-return scatter - Scatter plot of annualized return vs volatility for all companies with bubble sizes representing average trading volume, overlaid with efficient frontier curve

Each subplot must include appropriate legends, axis labels, and use consistent color schemes across related companies.
