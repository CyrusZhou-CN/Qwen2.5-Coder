## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 2x2 subplot visualization analyzing stock price volatility patterns across smartphone companies from 2016-2021. In the top-left subplot, display overlapping line charts showing the closing prices over time for Apple, Samsung, and Google Pixel with a secondary y-axis showing their respective trading volumes as area charts. In the top-right subplot, create a combination of box plots overlaid with violin plots to show the distribution of daily price changes (calculated as percentage change from previous day) for all 10 companies. In the bottom-left subplot, generate a heatmap showing the correlation matrix of monthly average closing prices between all companies, with a color bar indicating correlation strength. In the bottom-right subplot, create stacked area charts showing the cumulative percentage returns (normalized to start at 100%) for the top 5 performing companies over the entire time period, with scatter points marking significant market events (defined as days with >5% price change for any company).
