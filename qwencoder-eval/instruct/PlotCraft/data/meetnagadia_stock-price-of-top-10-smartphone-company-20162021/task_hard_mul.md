## Instruction
Create a comprehensive 3x2 subplot grid analyzing the temporal evolution and comparative performance of smartphone company stock prices from 2016-2021. Each subplot should be a composite visualization combining multiple chart types:

Top row (3 subplots):
1. Left: Overlay normalized closing price time series lines for Apple, Samsung, and Google Pixel with a secondary y-axis showing their combined trading volume as stacked area chart
2. Center: Combine line charts of monthly average closing prices for Nokia, LG, and Xiaomi with error bands showing monthly price volatility (high-low range)
3. Right: Display quarterly price change percentages as grouped bar charts for Lenovo, Vivo, and ZTE with overlaid trend lines showing cumulative returns

Bottom row (2 subplots):
4. Left: Create a dual-axis plot showing daily trading volume as bars for all companies with overlaid moving average lines (30-day and 90-day) of closing prices
5. Right: Combine correlation heatmap of monthly returns between all companies with marginal box plots showing return distributions for each company

The visualization should reveal market leadership patterns, volatility trends, seasonal effects, and inter-company correlations in the smartphone industry stock performance over the 5-year period.
