Top-left: Line chart showing closing prices over time for Apple, Samsung, and Google Pixel with a secondary y-axis displaying their 30-day moving averages. Top-right: Area chart showing the cumulative percentage returns from the starting date for Nokia, Xiaomi, and LG, overlaid with scatter points marking significant price peaks. Bottom-left: Combined line and bar chart displaying monthly average trading volumes (bars) and monthly price volatility (calculated as standard deviation of daily returns) as lines for Lenovo, Vivo, and ZTE. Bottom-right: Dual-axis plot showing the correlation between closing prices and trading volumes over time for Alcatel Lucent, with closing prices as a line chart and volume as filled area chart underneath.
